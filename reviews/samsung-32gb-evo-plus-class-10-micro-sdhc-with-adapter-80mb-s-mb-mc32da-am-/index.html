<h5 id="i-used-to-buy-only-sandisk-but-for-the-money-these-evo-cards-are-better-and-cost-far-less">I used to buy only Sandisk, but for the money, these EVO+ cards are better and cost far less!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome SD card for any price, but it&rsquo;s also as fast as many &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; cards costing several times as much! 93.11 MB/s reads and 76.13 MB/s writes! Also, the random reads and writes are insane fast. Even cheap SD cards can do fast sequential read speeds. But, typically only &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; cards can manage 12.35 MB/s random reads and 5.105 MB/s random writes! Actually, many &ldquo;Pro&rdquo; cards that cost $50 can&rsquo;t match those numbers. This card would work EXCELLENT for recording video (up to 4K) and high MP pictures. It would also be excellent for running an OS or used on your phone where there&rsquo;s many more random reads and writes (which this card EXCELS at).From now no, I&rsquo;m only buying Samsung SD cards. I used to buy only Sandisk, but for the money, these EVO+ cards are better and cost far less!</p>

<h5 id="samsung-evos-continue-to-impress">Samsung EVOs continue to impress</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a big fan of Samsung&rsquo;s EVO series of memory so I wasn&rsquo;t surprised to see good reviews and promising speed tests for this card.I haven&rsquo;t been able to run any speed tests of my own on this unit, but this card runs great in the RPi3 and hasn&rsquo;t had a single problem with it.I will definitely be getting more of these for more RPis and my other devices.</p>

<h5 id="samsung-makes-the-best-cards-handsdown">Samsung makes the best cards handsdown</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I pretty much only use samsung, I have several of the EVO&rsquo;s and never had a read/write issue with them. And mine have been in MANY gadgets. Most of mine are the white/yellow EVOs but this was actually cheaper that the standard EVO so I thought I would pick it up. Since these are mostly used in my dash cams or my go pro&rsquo;s I am not sure if the faster read/write speeds make a difference. I can say I have never had a failure, and never had a device not accept this card. I can&rsquo;t say that for Sandisk or Kingston.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="choose-carefully">Choose carefully</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cards I received were packaged in Chinese, did not include the SD adapter, and performed terribly. After noticing the slow performance I benchmarked them and found they had write speeds of between 1MB/sec-6MB/sec, depending on the particular unit. Between 5x-20x slower than what the genuine product delivers.Amazon won&rsquo;t let me post what I really think, so I&rsquo;ll just say to choose the seller carefully.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-item-worked-as-i-expected">This Item Worked As I Expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item for my grand daughter&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 kids. When I installed it (it simply snaps into a slot that&rsquo;s made for it), the system recognized it immediately. Don&rsquo;t worry if it reports a smaller storage capacity. Mine showed only 29GB. That&rsquo;s normal. Some manufacturers measure storage capacity differently from others. I would buy this item again, and I would recommend it to my friends.</p>

<h5 id="great-dash-cam-card">Great Dash Cam Card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought mine from Amazon. It&rsquo;s just a memory card. The one I got works well in my dash camera recording in 1080P at 30 FPS. And that&rsquo;s all I really care about as far as use goes. I did test it with h2testw which reported the card had the full 32GB. That&rsquo;s all I needed to know. After using it for I while I am quite pleased with it so far.</p>

<h5 id="what-a-relief-for-me-to-keep-my-projects-in-a-safe-place">What a relief for me to keep my projects in a safe place!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a writer and I like to use graphics with my writing and I was running out of data storage space and I still have more to add so I needed a reliable source for storing all of my work and I&rsquo;m so thankful that this Micro SD card has proven itself as a reliable source for me to keep my information so easily accessible!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-usd-card-in-a-nice-price-for-raspberry-pi-3">Excellent uSD card in a nice price! (For Raspberry Pi 3)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent uSD card in a nice price!This tinny uSD make rock my Raspberry Pi 3 B. I&rsquo;ve buy it thanks to this post from Jeff Geerling:[&hellip;]He said:&ldquo;This post&rsquo;s benchmarks were performed on a Raspberry Pi 2; for all the latest benchmarks, on Raspberry Pi 3 or later revisions, check out the official Pi Dramble microSD card Benchmarks page.In my experience, one of the highest-impact upgrades you can perform to increase Raspberry Pi performance is to buy the fastest possible microSD card—especially for applications where you need to do a lot of random reads and writes.There is an order-of-magnitude difference between most cheap cards and the slightly-more-expensive ones (even if both are rated as being in the same class)—especially in small-block random I/O performance. As an example, if you use a normal, cheap microSD card for your database server, normal database operations can literally be 100x slower than if you used a standard microSD card.&ldquo;Because of this, I went and purchased over a dozen different cards and have been putting them through their paces.

And this year, I&rsquo;ve seen it on sale for $10-20 for 32 or 64 GB, so it&rsquo;s a steal. Other than that, I&rsquo;d go with the SanDisk Extreme, as it can be had for about the same price, or the Samsung Evo (without the +), as it can be had for even less if you just need 8 or 16 GB.2015 Winner: Samsung Evo+ 32 GB (~$12 on Amazon)&rdquo;</p>
