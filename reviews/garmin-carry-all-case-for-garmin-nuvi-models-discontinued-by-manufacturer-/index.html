<ul>
<li>Rugged nylon carrying case</li>
<li>Two zippered compartments to hold your Garmin Nuvi GPS along with your cables, cords and mounts</li>

<li><p>Holds 3.5&rdquo;,4.3&rdquo; or 5.0&rdquo; size Garmin Nuvi GPS&rsquo;s</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>Package Type:Standard Packaging
The &ldquo;carry all&rdquo; carrying case is designed to store and protect your nüvi® and all of its accessories - a power cord, charger and mount.</p>

<p>Constructed of a durable nylon material, the case has 2 padded, zippered compartments. Store your 3.5&rdquo;, 4.3&rdquo; or 5.0&rdquo; nüvi in its own compartment so it&rsquo;s protected from scratches; the second compartment can be used to store the cables and mount.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="perfect-holds-everything">Perfect! Holds Everything.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect! It is a classic styled, soft case with two zippered pockets. One pocket is just right for my nüvi 2460 (a 5 inch screen). This pocket is just the right length for the nüvi with a blue, soft cloth lining. The second pocket is much bigger and in fact an inch longer than the first. This pocket is large enough for the cigarette lighter adapter cord, the mounting bracket and the suction cup, too! The trick is to place the suction cup at the end of the case opposite from the GPS unit. The zippers are the self healing nylon type and seem to be of high quality with a Garmin branded zipper pull.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="super-case-for-garmin-nuvi">Super Case for Garmin nuvi</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchased this case directly from Garmin before Amazon.com offered it because all the other cases I saw on Amazon seemed to be too small to contain the GPS unit and all accessories I purchased. This case, however, is great! It holds the Garmin nüvi 2595LMT 5-Inch Portable Bluetooth GPS Navigator with Lifetime Maps and Traffic I recently purchased from Amazon, the Garmin Friction Mount compatible with the GPS unit, and the power cable without any problem whatsoever. This sure came in handy on a recent trip that involved air travel, two different hotels, and rental car. This is definitely THE case to buy, especially if you have a 5-inch GPS unit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-case">Excellent Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent case for the Garmin Nuvi. The pocket for the GPS is padded and holds the GPS comforably. The remaining compartment holds everything else I have for the GPS except the dash friction mount. All the cords, suction mounts, mounting pieces and parts are easily stored there without undue pressure on the GPS pocket. This is a little spendy compared to other models, but the build quality and the fact that everything fits makes it a good value.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="needs-a-handle">Needs a handle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is great. It fits my 5&rdquo; Garmin Nuvi 2595LMT, the cords, and the portable friction dashboard mount perfectly. The only drawback I see is that it really needs some type of carrying handle/strap/etc. It is very awkward to carry it around without one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-case-for-your-garminh">Great Case for your Garminh</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really love this case! I just got a Garmin Nuvi 3590LMT a little less then two weeks ago and needed something to protect it to keep it looking like new, and this case certainly does the trick very nicely! It has two separate compartments; one for the mount and cables of your Garmin GPS, and the other for the GPS unit itself. Fits 4.3 inch, as well as 5 inch screens. Very tough and durable material and well stitched. I&rsquo;m not worried the least bit about my GPS getting damaged. I always have my GPS with me, even if I don&rsquo;t necessarily need it (but can never be sure if I wont need to drive to an unfamiliar area unexpectedly), and as a result, I carry all that I need in an over the shoulder (across the chest type) book bag. Before I would throw the GPS itself in a separate zippered pocket, and all it&rsquo;s accessories in the main compartment, along with other stuff, always having to then dig for the mount and charger. Now, having this one case and throwing it in said book bag is so convenient!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-but-needs-a-handle">Good product&hellip; but needs a handle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As one of the other reviewers wrote, this product would be perfect if it only had a handle.There are 2 compartments. One is marked with blue piping around its zipper, so you can quickly and easily identify it as the narrow, padded sleeve that is designed to hold the GPS unit itself. It accomodates my Garmin nüvi 3590LMT 5-Inch device nicely.The other pocket is great for keeping the cradle, cable(s), and mount together and protected.It is smooshable (soft-sided), which makes it easier to pack, but obviously less resistant to crushing or impact damage. This seems reasonable, unless you are subjecting your equipment to abnormal wear and tear (air-drops, mortar attacks, etc.)All in all, a satisfactory purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-well-designed-and-convenient-travel-solution-with-good-protection">A well designed and convenient travel solution with good protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this case to schlep around a nüvi 2457LMT. My nüvi fits well in a nicely lined and padded sleeve on one side while the rest of the hardware goes in a larger pocket on the other. A blue stripe adds flair to the case exterior and identifies the pocket containing the GPS device. For those who might care, the case is made of a fabric that is more comfortable to the touch than the customary ballistic nylon or pva. I like having a single case for the GPS and accessories - I can toss it in my carry-on bag for use in the rental car at my travel destination and it makes forgetting individual bits and pieces less likely. As others have suggested, a small carry handle or strap would be a useful addition. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="keep-it-together">Keep it together</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just right design. Holds everything necessary to keep in my suitcase so when I get out of an airport, I can unzip and hook it up in a rental car. Not a lot of excess space, but it all fits and fits well. No scratches or broken parts with everything jammed in to the little case. If you travel, or want to have a place to grab everything out of your car at the car wash, and keep it all together, this works better than any others I have seen or used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-case">Great Case !!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this is the 2nd on I have bought in the past 3 years it fits my Garmin Drive Smart 51 North America LMT-S GPS and its accessories with not problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-bag">Love this bag!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>GPS, cords and suction cup fit with room to spare. Don&rsquo;t think the bean bag holder will fit though if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-not-recommend">Would not recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to be made OK, smaller than I thought and definitely could use a handle. I have more accessories than will fit in this case so I won&rsquo;t be using it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good price and it is exactly like my old one. The old one fell apart after about 5 years.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="protective-compact-storage-for-gps-unit">Protective &amp; compact storage for GPS unit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The size and shape of the storage case are perfect for storing my gps in my car. It fits perfectly in the storage space located within the front passenger car door (or the driver&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-case-1">Great Case!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Case; fits everything from the suction cup mount; to the Garmin charger in one section; plus the display in another section; completely protected.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect travel carrying case. Mount, car charger and unit fits nicely in case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-carrying-case">Good carrying case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Portable and fits in the car&rsquo;s glove compartment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-was-very-disappointed-in-the-product">I was very disappointed in the product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very disappointed in the product. The first time I unzipped it.. The zipper split! I can&rsquo;t even use it. 😕😡</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-right-size">Good quality, right size.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything fits well and I feel the device is secure. I&rsquo;d recommend this to anyone who was planning on using the GPS in multiple locations and/or need to store it.</p>
