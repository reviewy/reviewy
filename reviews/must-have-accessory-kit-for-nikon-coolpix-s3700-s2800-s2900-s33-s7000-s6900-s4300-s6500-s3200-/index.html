<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="it-does-not-look-like-the-correct-charger-for-the-battery">It does not look like the correct charger for the battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The charger needs instructions. It does not look like the correct charger for the battery. It actually does work, but I had to complain to the company before getting an explanation as to how to place the battery. The space for the battery is too large, and the contacts don&rsquo;t match. The trick is that all of the contacts are not needed for charging, so if you put the battery in so that two of the contacts are touching, it charges just fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-stuff">Good stuff!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything was as described, the package was shipped and delivered when it said it would be, and the items are good quality! The case is pretty hard, which means it&rsquo;s as protective as you could ask for. The tripod is tiny, and the legs aren&rsquo;t as bendy as I thought they might be, but they may get that way after being used more?Definitely a good buy :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="take-a-second-look-the-battery-charger-does-match-the-coolpix-s6400">Take a second look - the battery charger does match the coolpix S6400</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A second battery for the coolpix S6400 is a mast. This kit includes a battery with much longer life compared to the one that originally comes with the camera. I practically stopped using the original battery and have the replacement one in the camera all the time, I charge it every week or so. The charger, at first look appears like it doesn&rsquo;t match the battery&hellip; however, after a closer look revels that it does. This charger is designed to fit several different batteries, and that is why it looks too large. The other accessories are nice, but I haven&rsquo;t tried them yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-accessories-except-for-the-tripod">great accessories except for the tripod.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my Nikon coolpix S6900 because I needed the extra battery, the travel and car charger, the screen protector and the case.what it comes with:* Vivitar - Deluxe Hard Shell Carrying Case. The dimensions are 2.75&rdquo;W x 1.25&rdquo;D x 4.5&rdquo;H* Extended Replacement Battery<em>AC / DC Rapid Travel Charger /Car Charging Adapter and European Plug</em> USB 2.0 SD Card Reader* Universal LCD Screen Protectors<em>a Mini tripod</em> butterfly microfiber cleaning clothThe case is the perfect size to carry the camera and extra battery. I like that it is not bulky as others I have had for compact cameras defeat the purpose of a compact camera.I&rsquo;ve only used the wall charger so far but it took a few hours to fully charge my battery.The replacement battery works as well as the one the camera came with an lasts as long as the one the camera came with.I haven&rsquo;t used the card reader just yet as my computer has card reader slots and since the camera is wireless, i can send photos wirelessly through my phone and an app for nikon.The lcd screen protector is just ok. You need to cut it down to the size of your camera&rsquo;s screen. There is a ruler guide to assist in your cutting and comes with a squeegee to get the bubbles out. The 1st one I applied came off right away at the corners. The second one I applied has stayed on but it isn&rsquo;t completely clear. You can tell there is a screen protector on it. but it keeps my screen from getting scratched so it does it&rsquo;s job.The mini tripod is kind of a joke. It wouldn&rsquo;t trust my camera to be on it. It kept falling over and just feels really cheaply made. and the smell. it has a strong smell to it! it&rsquo;s compact, yes. but I have others that are compact as well and way more sturdy! If you are looking for a tripod for your compact camera, this is not the best one.the lens cleaner does it&rsquo;s job.overall, I am happy with this purchase. only thing I don&rsquo;t like is the tripod!</p>

<h5 id="extra-battery-and-tripod-and-camera-case-yep-a-great-price-and-mates-well-with-coolpix-pns-models">Extra Battery and Tripod and Camera Case. Yep, a great price and mates well with Coolpix PNS Models</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ya want to reduce vibration and get good video and long exposure photos? Use the tripod. The extra battery and case paired with the Nikon Coolpix S6900 or similar, is a great value add.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="greater-than-expected">Greater than expected!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I mainly picked this out for the battery, charger, and case.The other stuff was icing on the cake.The only thing I was not totally thrilled with was the tripod. It&rsquo;s one of those flexible leg ones that seems like a cool idea, but I wasn&rsquo;t that big of a fan. Regardless, I&rsquo;m still giving this 5 stars because I didn&rsquo;t get it for the tripod. You can get a nice mini tripod with the AmazonBasics line of products which can be found at the following link: AmazonBasics Lightweight Mini Tripod</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-price">Worth the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charger works well as does the spare battery&hellip;the case is too big and the tri-pod has limited uses&hellip;if any at all.All-in-all, it is worth the price for what you get.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-complement-to-the-nikon-coolpix-camera">excellent complement to the Nikon coolpix camera.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an excellent complement the Nikon coolpix. A nice case to protect your camera, and a nice little tripod that you can carry in your pocket. The tripod is perfect for using the WiFi on your camera. And having extra batteries is always a good thing. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="get-it-for-the-battery-and-case">Get it for the battery and case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The extra battery and case make this worth the price. It was also nice to have the European adapter. I also used the tripod less as a tripod and more as a camera handle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-deal-i-mainly-needed-a-spare-battery-and">Great deal. I mainly needed a spare battery and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great deal. I mainly needed a spare battery and charger for a new camera. For the price all the extras were a bonus.</p>

<h5 id="good-value">Good value</h5>

<p>The digital card reader/writer did not work for me, but all other items were fine. It was a good value for the money.</p>
