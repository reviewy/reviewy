<h5 id="i-love-this-well-built">i love this well built</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i love this well built , easy to use &ldquo;point &amp; shoot&rdquo; camera for the uses I bought it for . I can leave it in my car to use for all of those &ldquo;Missed Opportunities &rdquo; that we all complain about&mdash;-Being accustomed to bigger , faster lenses however , I caution Buyers re expecting great results from these high power zoom capabilities&mdash;&ndash;The &ldquo;Power of magnification&rdquo; is there and the viewer on the back is a good size , but the results also depend on you having the lighting to see the viewer clearly &amp; your ability to hold the camera steady enough for such a range&mdash;-</p>

<h5 id="this-camera-is-very-user-friendly-and-she-has-taken-some-fantastic-photos-for-what-it-is">This camera is very user-friendly and she has taken some fantastic photos. For what it is</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter decided that she wanted a camera for her 13th birthday since i won&rsquo;t let her touch mine without leaving a kidney as collateral. I wanted to get her a point and shoot so that she could get her bearings in framing, composition, and lighting before graduating to a DSLR, but wanted something with the feel of a more advanced camera. This camera is very user-friendly and she has taken some fantastic photos. For what it is, she (or I) could not have asked for anything better. The different shooting modes are flawless and allow her to experiment with her subjects quickly and simply. I do have one gripe, unfortunately. This uses regular AA batteries, and they need replaced often. An every few uses type of often. Because of this, we opted for rechargeable batteries and keep an extra set in the case for when the power dies and that perfect moment presents itself (like mom drooling asleep in the car).</p>

<h5 id="bought-for-my-grandson-wants-to-take-pictures-for">bought for my grandson, wants to take pictures for &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>bought for my grandson, wants to take pictures for JROTC, really likes this camera, only draw-back was the battery life, got him some lithium batteries and hope this solves that problem</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="picture-perfect">Picture Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how I survive without this camera. I bought a refurbished one but you would never know. Pefect condition no stratches on the lens or camera. Beautiful clear pictures great zoom, easy functions. If you are just starting out in photograghy this is a perfect starter camera. everything the seller discribe is true about this camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-shots-easy-to-use">great shots, easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was bought as a gift for my son&rsquo;s 15th birthday. He requested a &ldquo;real&rdquo; camera as opposed to a pocket sizes point and click. I took it on a test drive yesterday before sending it to him. Drawbacks: no viewfinder, which I prefer to have, view screen no adjustable. Pro: great shots, easy to use, good selection for a novice getting used to choosing settings and scenes. Pictures mostly came out very well and I&rsquo;m more than willing to take the hit on the few that didn&rsquo;t. I suspect he will be quite pleased.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-like-this-camera-but-it-does-have-a-few-drawbacks">I really like this camera but it does have a few drawbacks &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this camera but it does have a few drawbacks that keep it from being a 5.Plus - if you&rsquo;re familiar with cameras, then this is one you can take out of the box and start using. There are more things it can do than you will initially intuit, but it&rsquo;s usable without knowing all the features. It isn&rsquo;t too heavy or awkward; as someone with arthritis in all my joints, that makes a difference on my hands, elbows, and shoulders. It zooms and pulls back fairly well/quickly and I don&rsquo;t find it loud or too slow, albeit I&rsquo;m not trying to take action or sporting shots. The quality of picture is excellent. I make my own prints and greeting cards and have received many compliments on the photos I&rsquo;m able to get with this camera (keep in mind, these are hobbies, not a livelihood - this isn&rsquo;t professional quality).Minus - as others have mentioned, this camera struggles to focus &lsquo;in the middle&rsquo; of it&rsquo;s zoom capacity. I also find it doesn&rsquo;t always do well at it&rsquo;s full zoom and will readjust itself before getting the shot, which can be frustrating and time consuming. My biggest complaint though would have to be it&rsquo;s poor performance with night/low light photography. In fact, it is for this final reason that I am now looking for a low end SLR that will allow me to take night and macro shots.For ordinary use, particularly for family and home pictures, I am very happy with this camera. It does well with landscape and portrait shots in normal lighting conditions and I&rsquo;ve taken some really lovely photos with this camera; the biggest drawback for me is not being able to take pictures of a night sky or in low light conditions (minus flash).</p>

<h5 id="amazing-camera">Amazing Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I could not be happier. We attended our grandson&rsquo;s graduation from the USMC at Parris Island SC . We took about 80 or so pictures and everyone was perfect. Even the ones where we zoom in. It was easy to download the pictures onto the computer and the ones we had printed via Rite Aid were amazing , so clear and sharp.</p>
