<h5 id="great-bag-and-very-sturdy">Great bag and very sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bag and very sturdy! The print is really beautiful and my colleagues have complemented the design and style of the bag. It&rsquo;s great size, fits everything I need for lunch, including my large container, fruits, snacks and anything else I am craving about! :) I also love the material, it&rsquo;s comfortable to carry on along with my purse, no matter if I drive or have to take public transportation, I always take this bag with me. It&rsquo;s very easy to clean, I just put it in the washing and drying machines and it&rsquo;s like new! I love it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-good-material">Really good. Material</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really good.Material, work is very good! The inside can be loaded with a lot of food. Also equipped with a can install mobile phone, credit card, key, change the small bag is very good。</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-great-lunch-box">Great great lunch box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great great lunch box! I bought several boxes before and this one is the most satisfied one I had. The material is comfortable and it is high quality. The room in this lunch box is huge. Inside the box, there is a small bag which can put the spoon and other small things in it. I love the color and the graphic pattern on the surface of the bag because it is very cultural related and beautiful. Recommended!</p>

<h5 id="i-can-feel-the-quality-is-very-good-the-important-thing-is-that-it-provides-a">I can feel the quality is very good. The important thing is that it provides a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would call this as a lunch bag set. it is made of certain spongy material and thick. I can feel the quality is very good. The important thing is that it provides a good insulation. I use it to bring lunch to the office everyday and The food is always still warm in the afternoon. The small wallet pouch can be used as an individual wallet by itself. It is a fashion design. The lunch bag has a large capacity. it can containing food enough for 2-3 persons. Hence it could be used as a food container in a small picnic of a 3-person family.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-bags-are-beautiful-i-love-the-pattern-and-unlike-some-other">The bags are beautiful! I love the pattern and unlike some other &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The bags are beautiful! I love the pattern and unlike some other reviewers, I don&rsquo;t find it to be faded out or distorted at all. The lunch bag is larger than most neoprene lunch bags &ndash; large enough to pack lunch or snacks for me and the kids for a small picnic at the park &ndash; which is a plus in my opinion, but it would probably be a bit too large for an individual child&rsquo;s school lunchbox for everyday. The smaller/wallet bag works great for my phone (but I have a smaller iphone, not the larger ones).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-lunch-bag-cute-holds-a-lot-lightweight">Great lunch bag; cute, holds a lot, lightweight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I looked at a lot of lunch bags before settling on this one. It&rsquo;s big enough to hold my large plastic tub of salad, several sandwich bags of veggies/fruit/crackers, and other misc. snacks. It&rsquo;s also lightweight and cute, and the zipper is helpful. The only thing I don&rsquo;t love about it is that there&rsquo;s a funky smell - plasticky? - on the inside that I hope will dissipate with time. It also looks easy to rinse/wipe out to keep it clean.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-daily-lunch-use">Perfect for daily lunch use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this for the beautiful graphics on the outside:) Well, there are tons of similar lunch bags of this design out there, but this one has the pattern I like the most, and it comes with a matching pouch for silverwares (won&rsquo;t fit for longer ones tho). I bring it with me every day to lunch now. It&rsquo;s not huge, but you can definitely stuff a great variety of food in there. This is great:)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-big-lunch-bag">Nice big lunch bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s much bigger than I thought , feel like two people&rsquo;s lunch can fit in it .lolIt&rsquo;s very soft and nice quality, and I like the design a lot . And the little bag is so cute , u can even use it as a purse instead of putting fork in it .👍</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-and-soft">nice and soft</h5>
