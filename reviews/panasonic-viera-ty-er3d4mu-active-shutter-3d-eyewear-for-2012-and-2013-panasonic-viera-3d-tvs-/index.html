<blockquote>
<p>Panasonic VIERA TC-P60ST50 60-Inch 1080p Full HD 3D Plasma TVPanasonic VIERA TY-ER3D4MU Active Shutter 3D EyewearI have had these glasses for about 2 weeks and have watched quite a bit of 3D content. I recently purchased a 2012 Panasonic Viera plasma set and I am very impressed with these glasses! They are active, so yes there is a battery in them but they do not feel heavy when you are wearing them. In fact, you nearly forget you are wearing glasses because the 3D content of a movie like &ldquo;Kung-Fu Panda&rdquo; or Transformers &ldquo;Dark of the Moon&rdquo; is so amazing! I say nearly forget, because your 3D field of view is slightly narrower while you are using the glasses.If you turn your head too far in either direction you will see the frames of the glasses and it can cause a somewhat odd visual for a few seconds. No big deal.The battery stays charged for a long time, I have only charged mine up once. I recommend a USB Hub in the near vicinity of your system so you can charge up multiple pairs of glasses simultaneously. I use a PS3 with a hub attached and it works fine for charging up the glasses and multiple controllers, but the PS3 has to be on.In summary, I would like to add this is my first 3D TV and my first plasma TV, so I am still getting used to everything. Apparently these glasses are not backward compatible with earlier Panasonic units, so be aware of that. Overall I am extremely happy with these glasses and I would happily recommend these to anyone who wants to immerse themselves in the 3D world. I would take the warnings about eye fatigue, etc. somewhat seriously though. After the Transformers movie I was ready to step away from the TV for a bit to get my eyes re-adjusted to the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;.<strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>As of last Friday, one pair of glasses will not charge. The indicator lights for a moment and then goes out and the glasses will not power up. I believe this problem is battery related, but it could also be the switch. I will update this review with more info as I figure out what is wrong. I am beyond the 30 day return period so I am thinking about ordering a replacement LiPo battery. It&rsquo;s tricky, but it is possible to remove and replace the tiny 40mAh battery. The other pair is working fine and holds a charge for days, even with 2-3 hours of use per day. I am very disappointed that these failed after only a few months. I wonder where they were manufactured? Any guesses?</p>

I find that I like the brighter image more, but on the occasions that you are noticing crosstalk, the Samsungs are nice because they pretty much annihilate it. If you want something in the middle (medium brightness and medium crosstalk in one package), then I recommend the ValueView. I see no benefit to the 3D Heaven glasses because they have the most crosstalk of them all and are not brighter than the Panasonics and are more than double the price. The Epsons are pretty good performers, just like the ValueViews but are over double the price, and are over quadruple the price of the Panasonics and Samsungs. The 3Active are not comfortable and perform exactly like the Samsungs at more than twice the price.At the end of the day I use the ValueView and Espons (which I got with my projector) the most, but use the Samsungs a bunch too. My wife likes the Panasonics the most because of brightness.More detailed review of all glasses below:(2x Pair) Samsung Rechargeable 3D Active Glasses, BlackSSG3300GRhttp://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Rechargeable-Active-Glasses-Black/dp/B004PYEBZ2?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03<em>s00Darkness: Like the 3ACTIVE glasses, these are tied as darkest of them all – slightly more blue than red/green color tooCrosstalk/Ghosting: Like the 3ACTIVE glasses, these are tied having the least crosstalk of them all (I assume the darkness means the shutters are open for less time, which equals less crosstalk)Comfort: Relatively comfortable – medium sized lens – they are the only pair that do NOT foldOperation: I found these to be the most annoying with no on/off switch – they always worked, but I can’t tell if the battery is draining or not all the time – it seems that bending the frames as you place them on your head turns them on and that they just time offPrice per pair: $20Adult Epson ELPGS03 3D Glasses 3D Heaven Rechargeable Compatible 3-D GlassesUltra-Clear HDhttp://www.amazon.com/ELPGS03-Glasses-Heaven-Rechargeable-Compatible/dp/B00GVLL8DK?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref</em>=oh_aui_search<em>detailpageDarkness: These are tied with the Panasonic as the brightest most red and green allowed throughCrosstalk/Ghosting: These have the most crosstalk of them allComfort: They are pretty comfortable with a nice surface finish – lens is smallOperation: No problems – time offPrice per pair: $40EPSON-Compatible ValueView® 3D Glasses.

<h5 id="more-3d-than-i-expected-and-worth-it-if-you-have-a-panasonic">More 3D than I expected and worth it if you have a Panasonic</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Panasonic 55 inch 3D smart plasma. The active 3D capability of these glasses supersedes any passive offering out there. In addition, these matched correctly with my plasma and the price was right since plasmas are going out and the drop to $40 each put them in range of my budget. My only advice on purchasing 3D movies is to research how the disc was created based on development time at the lab for the master copy. Several older movies from 10-15 years ago are produced at a &ldquo;cut rate&rdquo; one month development transfer level. I have two that are disappointing, partly because the original was only 2D and the corporate investment in development cut corners to mass produce an inferior 3D video. A good quality 3D film will have been released theater wide in 3D and usually requires up to 3 months to master the disc. Bad examples are the original Jurassic Park, Alice in Wonderland, and IRobot which do not display theater quality 3D. Good examples are Avatar and IMAX Under The Sea.</p>
