<blockquote>
<p>When I bought this case the GoPro 5 was not yet released and had intended to use it for the GoPro 4 Silver. I wrote the seller that I returned my GoPro 4 to replace with the newly launched GoPro 5 Black and the seller was gracious enough and more than willing to refund me but I decided to keep the case because it&rsquo;s a really nice protective case, well-built, sturdy and aesthetically good looking and I can use it for other gadgets. To my surprise, it worked really well with the GoPro 5 especially so with the Super Suit (pls look at the pic) which I always use not only for water-proofing (not being confident about the 5 being waterproof by itself, having read many instances/horror stories that water had seeped in when submerged in water) but to protect the camera lens as well and I use the Super Suit all the time whether in or out of water when shooting. Shown in the photo here is the other case that I bought, a bigger, cheaper one, but as can be seen, the foam is not of good quality (soft &amp; flimsy) while the GoRad is firm and much better (as they say, you get what you pay for). Also shown in the photo are the GoPro 5 wall-outlet Supercharger, the GoPro 5 dual charger, GoPro car cigarette lighter charger (a little tall but still ok), extra battery and various mounts including the hand-wrist mount. The zippered mesh top pocket is useful for keeping charging cables and other small accessories. Overall the GoRad case is not perfect but it&rsquo;s a really good buy that it had become my goto case for the GoPro Hero 5 Black kit, and will recommend it for other GoPro 5 owners who use the Super Suit as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>good product other than the inside pocket came with no zipper so it is not functional. If it would have come with a zipper I would give it 5 stars easy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-small-case">Great Small Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The construction is high quality and the foam seems very durable. It has protected the GoPro gear very well. It has been in check bag through the airport and with stood my two 4 year old throwing it on the ground full by my gear and not one thing has been damaged. My only wish is that instead of two LCD screen holders there would have been a slot for the wireless remote. Other than that I think these guys for a small company are on a great start to making high quality wonderful equipment for the GoPro line. I will continue to show off your products and tell people of the great quality that i am seeing.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I received my Boulder and I love it! It is a well built case and I have no doubt my Gopro is protected with this case. It is a perfect size for what I needed it for and I am very happy with it. The inside of the case allows me to store my accessories and the foam inserts are perfect. The zipper compartment is nice. Thank you for a great product!</p>

<h5 id="perfect-size-for-travel">Perfect size for travel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product is great.Recently I traveled to Southern Utah with it. The case held up great and protected all of the essentials. I was able to clip it directly to my carry on luggage as I traveled which means it didn’t take up any valuable space in my luggage. The size is perfect for what I need.Thanks for providing such a good quality product.</p>

<p>Pretty good case , built well</p>

<h5 id="i-am-more-happy-with-http">I am more happy with http</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overpriced and not-so-convenient. The net pocket does not have a zipper and can&rsquo;t be closed. I am more happy with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G24Z98G?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01which">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00G24Z98G?psc=1&amp;redirect=true&amp;ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01which</a> costs only $10.I actually completely took off the foam from it, and it became pretty roomy this way - has enough space for the camera, charger, camera box, holders, batteries, wires etc.</p>

<p>A bit smaller than I would have liked.</p>
