<h5 id="excellent-tv-mount-and-a-trick">Excellent TV mount and a trick</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Outstanding design and construction! Easy to assemble. The hooks from which the TV hangs are large, making it very easy to mount TV once the main assembly is attached to the wall. I had the follow issue-where I want to center the TV was right over a stud. I mounted a 3x1 ft by <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo;piece of maple to the the studs to either side of the center stud. I would have also put screws into the center stud if my TV was heavy but at only 37 lbs did not feel that necessary. I then screwed the TV mount to the board with 10 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> by 1&rdquo; lag screws. Using this system, you could attached the mount anywhere left-to-right on the board, would not need to be centered</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="omg">OMG!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OMG! If you are looking for a super high quality articulating mount this is it. Look no further. I love this mount and will only use Echogear mounts going forward. I&rsquo;ll even recommend to all my friends and family. It&rsquo;s a rock solid mount and the quality is superior. Check out my mount job.</p>

<h5 id="echogear-recommend-buy">ECHOGEAR Recommend Buy !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I assembled and installed the ECHOGEAR Full Motion Articulating TV wall mount to a brick wall. Then I installed an old Sony 46&rdquo; KDL-46V2500 LCD TV in 51&rdquo; enclose which is heavier than 70&rdquo; LED TV. It was a chore for two people to mount the Sony TV just because of the weight. No problem for one person to assembling and install ECHOGEAR. I plan to replace TV with a 70&rdquo; LED TV this November. At that time I will purchase my second ECHOGEAR full motion bracket to install in my study. I see no evidence of instability with the bracket what so ever, it is solid engineering. The wife loved the fact that we can pivot the screen so she can see TV from the kitchen which is at right angle to the wall that TV is mounted on. It is just about impossible to expect a masonry bit to be dead center but not to worry with ECHOGEAR, the level adjustment was simple to null out the leveling error so LCD was perfectly level for viewing. It was easy to install the two TV rails on the back of the TV, I used two of the longer screws included in the ECHOGEAR kit. I am delighted with the functionality and quality of ECHOGEAR so much so as I stated early I am purchasing a second one. That one will be mounted on a normal sheet rock wall in my Study and I am looking forward to easier installation. Even if I would keep the TV close to the wall being able to extend it away from the wall facilitates plugging in all the cables. I think the fact that I am buying a second one for the Study says all you need to know. I am satisfied ECHOGEAR customer. Update, installed my second ECHOGEAR in the Study this past week to the studs in the sheet rock wall.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This wall mount was a breeze to install, and the hardware felt like a precision machine. The packaging of the small parts into individual packets made the process even less painless. We mounted a 65&rdquo; 4k TV and it operates smoothly right outta da box. To achieve on-the-wall centering we first installed a pre-finished 12&rdquo;x36&rdquo; shelf board to the studs, using the included lag screws and a couple of additional 4&rdquo; wood screws. With the board firmly in place, we mounted the ECHOGEAR to the board with six <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub> x 1&rdquo; lag screws, pre-drilling pilot holes. Used 4 screws along the top rail &amp; 2 at the bottom corners. Then we completed the install when a buddy came by to hang the TV on the mount. Very pleased with the articulation range and smooth operation.</p>

<h5 id="buy-it-now">Buy It - Now!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was quite dismayed on receiving the mount box. It was tiny! OMG, I thought, this is going to be some ungodly conglomeration of small parts engineered to fit in small, flat package, ala IKEA.Nope, this mount is a robust chunk of heavy-gauge steel. It&rsquo;s <em>beautifully</em> made (as well as designed), smooth in operation, though stiff when new, and dead simple to put together and mount. I particularly appreciate that you have some leveling capability after the mount is up. I also didn&rsquo;t appreciate, until the TV was up, that there is a good amount of side-to-side positioning available, as well as tilt and swing, due to the way the support arms work.The finish on the mount is as flawless as the design. It has a really good coat of paint (may be powder coat - not sure about that), and not a burr, bit of flash, or sharp edge ANYWHERE. Everything is smooth, radiused, surface finished, and painted perfectly.All fasteners are included, including lag bolts for the wall. They are packaged - wait for it - in a compartmented strip of heavy plastic bag &hellip; each type of fastener in its own compartment and labeled! I&rsquo;ve never seen anyone else do that. The quality of the hardware appears good and it, like the mount, is painted and matches. Machine screws and spacers are provided to match a wide variety of TV fastener needs.The only thing that extended my installation was the discovery that my walls are steel framed (this is an apartment). So I needed to use anchors and not the provided lag bolts. No problem, just took a run to the store. I had a brief scare after opening everything up thinking my TV wasn&rsquo;t compatible, but quickly figured out there were hidden mount points under a piece of the table-top mount that I hadn&rsquo;t removed yet. When I called EchoGear support, I had someone on the line within a couple of minutes. Terrific service.I couldn&rsquo;t be happier with this mount. Stellar quality at a world-beating price. I almost bought a full-motion mount at Best Buy for nearly $200. And the EchoGear mount is a far better product for a MUCH lower price. It simply cannot be beat.</p>
