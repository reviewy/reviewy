<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="worth-the-money">Worth the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charges faster than my other ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-update">Great update</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The LED lighted usb ports are very useful. My cig lighter port is buried in the center console, so the light helps find the port.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love anker products!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding-car-charger">Outstanding car charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Outstanding car charger. I have an Anker wall charger and love it. That&rsquo;s why I bought this one. This works fantastic to charge at a high current. I love that it senses what current the device needs.Make sure you use good USB cables with this charger. It puts out fairly high current and a cheap cable will get REALLY hot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="charges-fast-looks-nice-anker-is-awesome">Charges fast, looks nice, Anker is awesome!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had this product for very long or used it much (only twice, I believe), but so far I&rsquo;m very pleased with it. It charges really fast! I have a Samsung phone and I&rsquo;m used to their fast chargers, I think this is equally fast at about 1% per minute while I was playing music on Spotify. I love the LED light around the ports, it looks nice and it is useful when driving at night.Another big plus about this product and any other Anker products is the 18 month warranty and their fast response time for warranty claims. I recently got a replacement for a Micro USB cable that I purchased a little over a year ago and had intermittent charging issues. It was a quick and uncomplicated process and I got my replacement cable in four days, I believe.I must say that I only tried the charger with one device at a time. I don&rsquo;t know if connecting two devices would affect the charging speed, but I wouldn&rsquo;t expect it to.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-car-charger">Excellent Car Charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Anker products are so great. I love how this works in the car. Both my wife and I charge our phones or I can charge my phone and Fitbit. These look cool too!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-charger-that-really-does-adapt-to-what-you-plug">Great charger that really does adapt to what you plug &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great charger that really does adapt to what you plug in to it. Have one phone that will not charge properly with any (including original charger) wall charger. This charger will charge it up just fine. Only reason its not 5 stars is mostly because of my miss reading however it does state elite full charge and only Qualcomm quick charge is not supported. It does not quick charge any phone. I did get an email from Anker stating that this was the case but it came after the item was already shipped. If you do not need the quick charge this by far the best car charger I have used.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-car-charger-charges-your-phone-fast">Excellent Car Charger; Charges Your Phone Fast!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the second Anker Car Charger I have owned. I basically bought this one because I preferred the design on it to my current model (I had the model with the red circle; still a great charger). My dash lights are blue so I felt this one matched inside my vehicle better. I also liked the fact the USB ports are always lit up on this version. Note: This is NOT the fast charge version. There is a quick charger with the same design of this, but costs around 10 dollars more. If that is the version you want, this is NOT it.I have used many Anker products, and I find them to be high quality. Although this is not the fast charge version, this is still a very fast charger! I believe the charger is made to use the most power when charging your device, and using the iQ technology it can detect the max for your device and use it. So this can provide 2.4A thru each USB port. Personally that is quick enough for me.Overall this is another great Anker product. For the price tag I think it is definitely worth the money, and the product should last (I had my prior Anker car charger for a year, and it still is in great working condition, so I expect this one will last a long time as well). The design is also appealing, and slim. This minimizes space and does not stick out far from the aux input. If you are in the market for a car charger, you cannot go wrong with any of Anker&rsquo;s offerings!Edit: I tested this recently while using GPS on my phone to see if it would still charge the phone. It actually did still charge my phone albeit at a much slower rate. I was mostly happy my phone did not lose power with the GPS in use so I think this is an excellent charger. For a 25ish minute car ride I think it went up about 7% which I found good for a non quick charger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="charges-as-promised">Charges as promised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works. Also does not get hot as some of the very cheap car chargers do.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-car-charger-but-doesn-t-support-qualcomm-quick-charging">Good car charger but doesn&rsquo;t support Qualcomm Quick Charging</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good charger, but does not support quick charging my Samsung Galaxy S7. I must have misread the description when I purchased this because I wanted the quick charge capability.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It Works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as designed not nearly as fast as its stronger brother &ldquo;Anker Quick Charge 3.0 39W &ldquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="meets-needs">Meets needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well on both ports for charging and connections. If you want to increase the connectivity in your vehicle, this is a fine product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great charger! and Semi low profile keeps it out of the way</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">Amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super fast charging in my truck. Didn&rsquo;t realize charging could get any faster for my iPhone until I started using Anker chargers in my home and cars!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>NO PROBLEMS SO FAR</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="anker-makes-great-products">Anker makes great products</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Anker just plain makes good products. This is (I seem to remember) 2.4 amp per port, which is great for charging our iPhones (and iPads if needed).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-glad-i-got-it">Works great! Glad I got it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my dual charger. I travel a lot and am usually in the car with 3-4 other people and this comes in handy so we can all be charged up and ready to go. Easy. Lights up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product was what I wanted and it works great.</p>
