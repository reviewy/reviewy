<blockquote>
<p>Small and compact it canfit in your pocket. It&rsquo;s a tough little guy. I&rsquo;ve crash landed multiple times as I&rsquo;m learning to fly it and so far it&rsquo;s still going strong.They recommend using the &ldquo;gravity&rdquo; mode for starting out and I suggest the same. When I had it on the regular mode it would shootoff in a strange direction and I had a hard time controlling it.On gravity mode you need to hold your phone horizontal (parallel to the floor) and you will have much better control when starting out learning to fly this. The camera is actually not bad. Not good mind you but it&rsquo;s an under $50 quad-copter with a WiFi camera, what do you expect? Red &ldquo;tail&rdquo; lights are the back of the drone, blue are on the front. I had some pixelation issues while recording live feed. Maybe my phone or where I was flying it? I&rsquo;ve seen a couple other videos in reviews of this where they didn&rsquo;t have the same issue.In my video you can see how easy it is to fly with the gravity mode and I have some in flight footage as well.Can&rsquo;t beat it for the price. If you think you want a drone, especially if you want to film with it and don&rsquo;t want to fork over hundreds or even well over a thousand dollars than try this little guy out, see if you like it and whether you have the patience to learn how to fly them. Then move on to the professional ones (but still keep this one around just for fun!)</p>

<p>This drone is a lot of fun! We only had to download the app onto my husband&rsquo;s phone and try out the controls. We actually got it flying! We&rsquo;re not experts but this is a great drone to learn some flying techniques through the app. Next time we&rsquo;ll work with the camera!</p>

<h5 id="fun-and-easy-to-use-drone">Fun and easy to use drone!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is a great beginner drone. It is easy to control using a simple application that you can download onto your phone using a QR code or searching the app store. The drone is easy to control, which makes flying it a lot of fun. I gave it to my teenage son and he has been flying it non-stop. I am so happy it comes with a spare battery to give him more time to fly and have fun. You can see in my video how easy it is to control this drone, the video was the first time we tried it!</p>

<h5 id="camera-included-makes-a-great-gift">Camera included makes a great gift!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for my nephew because he was looking for something a little smaller to fly than the huge drone his mom got him for last Christmas. He loves this. He was looking for something a little easier to handle and I nailed it with this drone. The drone is controlled by an application you download to either your smartphone or your tablet and you are ready to go. The camera works great and can take still photos from a hover position or take video during hover or actual flight and be able to see where you have flown and what you were able to capture. It has a good flight height and distance so you can take this pretty far out, with emergency stop and a return to home feature you will not lose the drone in flight. The drone lands softly to minimize crashes when you are just learning, however, the company covers that with extra blades if you damage one and need to replace it. The one thing I liked about it (this way I could play with it) it has one touch take off and landing for those of us with no experience flying a drone it will go to a preset altitude that you can adjust as you get comfortable in flying. It can do flips and turns and all the fun little tricks he is still learning to do and with an extra battery included you get more flight time and can be charging the other battery while in flight with the spare. Included in the package are the quadcopter, 2 batteries, 4 spare blades, drawstring storage bag, screwdriver and a detailed user manual that explains how to use the drone so you get the best enjoyment possible and know how to use all the features included. My nephew is in love with it and flies it almost every night as a way to unwind after a long day at work.</p>

<h5 id="this-rc-quadcopter-drone-is-a-good-investment-for-beginners">This RC Quadcopter Drone is a good investment for beginners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this drone to use as a family toy. This RC Quadcopter Drone is a good investment for beginners. The drone itself is small and portable. The wings of it, fold in and out for storage. To use, you have to download the an App tp your phone or tablet. Flying it was easy once you figured out the controls. This drone is able to take pictures while flying. ( Selifes are kinda tricky to take if you are just learning to fly the drone) My family has had fun playing with this. The battery doesn&rsquo;t last long, so flying time is only about 7-10 minutes, but included with it is another battery. The battery can be charged with a USB cable that is included with it. So far we haven&rsquo;t had any problems with it busting or breaking when crashing. The blades it self seem to be very durable, so fun can be had a for a while.</p>
