<h5 id="best-vr-camera-for-the-price-point-and-easy-to-use">Best VR camera for the price point and easy to use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a virtual reality software engineer who has had experience with the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift DK2 and new consumer version, and various other devices.I have also used the M15 in the past. The form factor of both devices was great and I ultimately chose to buy the newer model due to the ability to make longer videos. In the M15, the resolution is too low and the contrast in picture quality is not great, where colors appear undersaturated and flat.The S, in contrast, is definitely a notch above the m15. However, this device is still prone to overexposure when taking 360 photos outside. The Theta S is a big improvement than its predecessor, but in my opinion not enough to warrant purchasing an entirely new device if you have the older model.You get 25 minutes to record 1080 HD video as opposed to 6 minutes on the M15, but keep in mind that uploading it into Youtube truly skews the image quality so the videos do not truly feel like HD. However, the Ricoh Theta software will auto stitch your video while exporting which minimizes the time spent editing, saving the consumer many hours. The videos are not completely seamless and are subject to some fish-eye distortion.The S comes with live preview, which uses the WiFi capabilities enabled in the camera itself. The shutter range is small, and you must be close to the camera for reliable operation. While it is neat to have this capability, the shoddy execution from the weak range leaves something to be desired.The S comes with a neoprene sleeve that fits snugly against the camera. However, we decided to buy a hard case for added lens protection, as Ricoh does not offer a warranty in the case that the lens themselves become damaged.The S controls are extremely easy to use, and just the press of a button will take a 360 photo. However, if you want the images to look as beautiful as they can, a fair amount of post processing might still be required to get the dynamic range seen in reality.Overall, I feel like this is the best VR camera you can get at this price point. The quality will not be able to rival a GoPro VR rig, but the amount of effort required in post production is severely minimized by Ricoh Theta. With a GoPro rig, you need to spend 2,500 dollars and also buy or #D print a mount to house all of the camera together. It also requires that you sync the individual shutters and control the settings so that the VR immersion isn&rsquo;t disrupted by the varying exposures, which can take a lot of time. The Ricoh Theta S is a great introduction to the world of VR, and is able to fit in such a small form factor that is extremely portable.As an avid Amazon shopper, I rely heavily on reviews to research before purchasing items. I purchased this item with my own money after doing my own research on what was available. I want to help others make more informed purchasing decisions by providing reviews that accurately describe the product and my experiences with it. I have no relationships with this seller, nor am I compensated on how people vote: if you learned anything helpful about this product from my review, please click the yes button, and if you did not learn anything new, please click the no button. Your vote will help me pinpoint what types of reviews people think are most useful.

<h5 id="too-much-fun-for-humans">Too much fun for humans</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I went with this purchase after seeing how expensive and complex it would be to use a go pro cluster. Since this device is about as convenient in VR photography and video as the Flip was I bought years ago for HD video this struck me as perfect for the amature use I have in mind. And I am cheap. Differences I am learning to live with is no idea what the camera is seeing without a smartphone until after I load the video on my computer. But so far I am okay with that and believe it or not still use a dumb phone instead of one that would do that for me. But actually, if use of this warrants that might actually be the app that pushes me finally in that direction. One odd thing with this camera I am curious about hearing from others regards the video results being counterintuitive for me. I initially used the camera vertically but found the video to require using the Oculus Rift from a tilt to the side to see the video correctly. So next I used a tripod that allows the camera to be fixed horizontally. Seems counterintuitive. Is that the way others have to use it?Update: don&rsquo;t drop it. I did and since then the one lens has taken much fuzzier pictures which makes half the image blurry. Rather than replace it though I am waiting for the V to come out this month,</p>

<h5 id="hard-to-beat-for-the-money">Hard to Beat for the Money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price, the functionality offered in this little camera is hard to beat. I couldn&rsquo;t see myself going higher dollar for such a specialized type of tool, so I&rsquo;m fine with trading off the finer detail at a distance. It works precisely as described and the sharing via the included app both on the Theta site and via social media worked exactly as expected. A fun camera for a very reasonable price. Connectivity and function with my iPhone 7S have proved excellent!</p>

<p>So awesome. Takes pictures to a hole other level. Great for big groups just have everyone circle around so you don&rsquo;t have to make sure you&rsquo;re all crammed in a little frame</p>

<h5 id="it-was-fun-for-a-day-or-two-but-i-don-t-see">it was fun for a day or two but I don&rsquo;t see &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for our business. We are an engineering firm and we take this with us to job site visits. It&rsquo;s really helped out when we are back in the office discussing the job. We can look anywhere we want while watching the video. As for home/family use, it was fun for a day or two but I don&rsquo;t see using it for family events very much.</p>

<h5 id="battery-won-t-hold-a-charge-can-t-use">Battery Won&rsquo;t Hold A Charge - Can&rsquo;t Use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sadly I cannot give this product a good review. After purchasing this nearly 11 months ago it sat in its protective case going largely unused. Last month I finally decided to use it on my cruise to Alaska and planned to get some great 360 degree photos of my travels. I plugged it in overnight to charge and the fully charged indicator never clicked on. As soon as I connected to my iphone to take pictures it shut down. Now it only turns on when plugged in; clearly a battery issue. The one time I wanted to use it, I could not, so I am not very happy about that especially on such an expensive camera.</p>
