<h5 id="fabulous-light-fabulous-deal">Fabulous light, fabulous deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are great lights, and they&rsquo;re a steal at this 3-pack price (which includes 9 alkaline batteries). Construction is very solid, and I like the fact that the battery cover (the base) screws on securely. In its storage position it is very compact, and when extended (which turns it on), the light is very bright. Manufacturer says it&rsquo;s 60 lumen, but it seems even brighter than that, because light is emitted in a true 360°pattern. With a 10-year warranty, this is my favorite emergency light: I have one in my go-bag, one in the car, and one in the nightstand.</p>

<h5 id="safe-bright-and-convenient-to-use-replaced-my-mantle-lanterns-and-rechargeable-6v-lanterns-can-t-live-without">Safe, Bright, and Convenient to use. Replaced my mantle lanterns and rechargeable 6v lanterns. Can&rsquo;t live without.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These lights are bright and handy. Here&rsquo;s some thoughts:Pros:- Safety. They are cool to the touch and perfectly safe to let my kids use in camp. Can&rsquo;t say the same for my propane mantle lanterns.- Price, price, price! I got these on an Amazon Deal of the Day, and I think I paid something like $4 per lamp in a 3-pack. How can you beat that?- Brightness. They are very bright and light up 360 around camp/room. I do like that by raising and lowering the light body, you can moderate how much light is being thrown.- Battery life. We used these around camp for a week and the first set of batteries are still in use. I was particularly surprised how long the batteries have lasted. I have done no scientific study to see how long they will last on a set (especially where each battery type will differ in longevity), but they lasted for a week of camping with regular use. That&rsquo;s all I need to be satisfied.- Ease of use. You grab the base and lift up on the handles and the light raises and simultaneously turns on. The more you lift the body, the more light you get. How simple!- Size. These things are small and lightweight. But, they still through great light.Cons:- Haven&rsquo;t found any yet.Overall, these things are awesome! I love them. They have replaced both my propane-powered mantle lanterns and my lanterns with rechargeable batteries. They&rsquo;re just too easy to use and convenient. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about recharging batteries on my old 6v rechargeable lantern or dealing with propane, mantles, or extreme temperatures of my mantle lanterns. What a pleasure to use, and the kids are safe to use them themselves with no danger.I hope I have helped your purchasing decision of this product.

<h5 id="lifesaver">LIFESAVER</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We just endured Hurricane Matthew on the Atlantic coast of Florida. 9 people and 3 dogs huddled in a small house for 2 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> days with no power. Thankfully I had just ordered and received a 3 pack of these lanterns about 1 week before the hurricane. Even though everyone had flashlights and candles, these lanterns were what illuminated the majority of our living areas. What a lifesaver! Life was so much easier having the Etekcity portable LED lanterns. They performed beyond my expectations in brightness, portability and low battery consumption. When we were finally allowed to leave the house and return to our own home, everyone wanted to know where they could get their own lanterns for future emergency use. Whether you camp or just want to outfit an emergency kit, these LED lanterns are a must. I know I&rsquo;ll always have them in my emergency supplies!</p>

<h5 id="bright-lights">Bright lights!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband ordered these to use in an emergency OR in the event our boys wanted to use their tent in the backyard. They are small, sturdy and compact. The LED lights are BRIGHT- when the lanterns are at full strength it&rsquo;s almost blinding. However, you can pull the lights up/Down to as much or little light as you need. *it would be nice if it had three settings or some sort of light filter. They run on the included AA batteries which are inexpensive and easy to find. Especially, in an emergency. Overall, they are nice and will be good to have in the cars, basement, and other uses around the house.</p>

<h5 id="great-compact-design-plenty-of-light">Great compact design, plenty of light!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow! What a deal, these little lanterns came up on a Extreme Deals blog I follow. Did I need them? No. But such a deal that I did grab them. And after getting them and using for a couple days, decided to get a second set and use as individual gifts.The hubby recently started working a 12-hour night shift from home. So he is always trying to sneak around an be quiet while I am sleeping, not turning on lights, etc. These are perfect, when he comes in from his back-house office, he just uses the lantern to see and it&rsquo;s not like big blarring lights. We live in the country and are having company come in a couple months, so we got these for them to use a nightlights also.</p>

<h5 id="pretty-good-lanterns-for-emergency-and-camping-use">Pretty good lanterns for emergency and camping use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These seem like great little lanterns. I bought a few sets of them in case of a power outage. They are only rated for 60 lumens a piece which is not much considering a typical 60 watt light (or equivalent) is about 800 lumens. However, the light these lanterns put out is a very white light. I tested them in my great room which is about 15x30 feet one night. Two lanterns, placed on opposite sides of the room, gave me enough light to be very functional. I definitely would have been able to navigate my house without tripping or having to move them. However, I would have needed a third one close to me to be able to read a book as there was not enough light to be able to do that. These lanterns run on three AA batteries. They are also a lot smaller than I initially expected. As far as using for camping, I think they would be great for that purpose. I just do not think I would trust them being water resistant very long do to an o-ring wearing out due to the nature these pull on and push closed.</p>
