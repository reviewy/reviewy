<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="used-camera-not-new">Used camera, not new</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The camera works great. Just like the first wireless camera, same model, that I bought last year. However, I thought I was buying a new camera. There is no mention of the camera being used or refurbished in the product description. I thought it was odd when I opened the box and saw that the camera packaging was torn. Also, the stickers that came with my other camera were missing from this one and this camera&rsquo;s owner&rsquo;s manual had food stains. When I set up the camera I found that the previous owner&rsquo;s full name and cell phone number were still programmed into the camera. When the camera sends photos to my phone the text comes in under the previous owner&rsquo;s name. I would not have paid $287 for a used or refurbished camera. The camera works flawlessly, however.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="from-other-companies-and-this-camera-is-by-far-superior-first">&hellip; from other companies and this camera is by far superior. First</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had several wireless cameras from other companies and this camera is by far superior. First, the trigger speed is really fast. I have had running deer in the middle of the frame&hellip;that&rsquo;s fast! The clarity is fantastic and the website used to manage the camera is outstanding. The set up is easy to do and even a &ldquo; 60 year old&rdquo; can do it. I will be buying more of these cameras. Worth the money .</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="have-realistic-expectations-and-know-your-signal-strength">Have realistic expectations and know your signal strength.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this after reading reviews and knowing it&rsquo;s limits. Yes, you need a good signal to get real time pics. I didn&rsquo;t even consider it in a low service property I have and stick with checking cards manually. I first put in medium signal area that bounces between 1-4 bars. While I didn&rsquo;t get immediate texts when I walked in front to test I did load many shots when it did get signal later in the day, including deer pics that happened after I left. A few days later I moved to a high signal area and got immediate texts as I hunted over the camera with deer walking in front of it. So I guess you need to be realistic on your expectations.As far as the website and app I&rsquo;ve gotta admit it&rsquo;s pretty nice. I can remotely change setting, can download or share pics easily, the GPS is accurate and best of all I can load data plan from website. Another brand I had made me go to the AT&amp;T store each month to reload and then explain that I only wanted a data package and they messed it up half the time.Photos are very good and just what I expected. It will be a great tool to keep me out of the woods until I see daytime buck movement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">LOVE IT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical but I LOVE this camera!! We were recently robbed and we got this as a security camera. It takes great pictures with lots of detail day/night. It&rsquo;s reliable, we get text images sent directly to my phone over a cellular network, and it also loads the pics to an app you can download. LOVE this camera and will definitely be buying another in the future!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-it-s-awesome-i-have-not-had-any-false-triggers">but it&rsquo;s awesome. I have not had any false triggers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have only had it a week. but it&rsquo;s awesome. I have not had any false triggers. every pic has a animal in it I can&rsquo;t state the long term.but I&rsquo;ve used the non wireless version for two years. exact same cam just no texting i had 3 of them and never had any issues. and for the money the picture quality can&rsquo;t be beat. only thing better is a $500 reconyx.I have owned spypoint and used a friends covert and this is leaps ahead. at&amp;t is not a issue in my area. and im am getting text within a minute from the time the pic is taken. I would suggest you take a at&amp;t cell phone, to the area you plan to use it. if you have good reception on it,you should be good to go. this is a game changer. it&rsquo;s the instant text we all been waiting for.</p>

<h5 id="bought-two-for-security">Bought two for security</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two for security at my dad’s ranch, can’t tell you how impressed I’ve been. Pictures are high quality and haven’t had issues with reception (his place is literally in the middle of no where). Will buy another one for my place</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ll-never-go-back-to-a-traditional-game-camera">I&rsquo;ll never go back to a traditional game camera.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been using this camera for about a month. I am a hunter but bought it to use for security and surveillance on a new house we are building.I was under the impression that only AT&amp;T users could purchase this camera. This is not the case. The data you use comes directly from bushnell as a monthly service. True, it is AT&amp;T data but you cannot add it to your existing plan. Starting at $9.99 a month you get 1,000 downloads. I opted for the $19.99 3,000 download option.Setup was very easy and I highly recommend downloading the bushnell app as you can change the settings on the camera remotely. The camera has a &ldquo;field scan&rdquo; option which is supposed to let you view the area such as a food plot without the camera being triggered at a set period of time which you specify. I have not been able to get this option to work which is the only reason I am not giving the camera 5 stars.The picture quality is very good. GPS pinpoint was within inches of its exact location. The camera sends pictures within a minute of taking them in most cases.Overall this is a great camera with multiple uses outside of just game photos. It&rsquo;s working great as a surveillance/security camera on our construction site. We know when subs are there and can see the progress they&rsquo;ve made. This would be great for a remote piece of property where no wifi is available to keep an eye on things. As long as you have decent AT&amp;T phone reception, $9.99 a month is pretty cheap security after the initial investment in the camera.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-me">Perfect for me!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has been such a game changer for me! I live in Texas but my hunting property is located in Kansas, so being able to consistently check and change my cards was a real hassle before this. Now I get up to the minute updates directly to my phone! Everytime I see the Bushnell App icon notification on my phone, I get an immediate rush! Makes it very simple to know if you have deer in your spot before you head to your stand as well. Absolutely love it so far!</p>

<p>bushnell has stood behind this product , the refurbished one was sent back and exchanged / and programmed to my existing account / subscription for picture transmission.</p>
