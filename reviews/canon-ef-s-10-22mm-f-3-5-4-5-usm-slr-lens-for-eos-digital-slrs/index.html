<h5 id="great-for-architecture">Great for Architecture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this lens for a little over a year now and have used it quite a bit. This lens is great for shooting architecture and good for landscapes and other things where you want to get a lot into the photo like large crowds. I&rsquo;m an architecture student and I usually bring this lens with me to analyze and catalog buildings. The super wide angle means that you can get shots of even the tightest of spaces. For exterior shots, you can really get the whole structure in there from standing fairly close to it. I got the whole Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel in Paris near the Louvre from just a few feet away. Going all the way down to 10mm, you can get a very striking two-point perspective style (Google: &ldquo;two-point perspective&rdquo; to see what I mean) shot that is very impressive. I will usually use this lens to get exterior shots and interior shots of whole rooms, and then switch to a 50mm lens to get detail shots.It works well for landscapes also, but I feel like the further and more expansive the landscape is, the more the photo suffers from blurring. I have tried taking some cityscape shots and they did not turn out nearly as sharp as they did using a prime lens. I have noticed some vignetting on this lens as well. On a Canon Rebel T3i, this lens is so large that it blocks out a portion of the built-in flash, so if you don&rsquo;t have an external flash and you plan to use this lens in the dark, that&rsquo;s something you will need to take into account as it is quite noticeable. This lens doesn&rsquo;t perform very well in low light situations unless you are using an external flash, taking a long exposure or using light painting techniques.Finally, this lens utilizes the EF-S mounting system, which only works on APS-C sensors. If you&rsquo;re planning on eventually upgrading to a camera with a &ldquo;full frame&rdquo; sensor, you will not be able to use this lens on that camera.</p>

<h5 id="best-ef-s-i-own-distortion-at-10mm-stm-version-exists">Best EF-S I own, distortion at 10mm, STM version exists</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a terrific lens!I understand there is a newer model with a shorter range but new STM focusing that is better for video. My lens focuses fine, quickly and accurately enough to easily make very nice images although I don&rsquo;t do much video. At this range I think a fast USM focus would be overkill.Overall I&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s my favorite EF-S lens. It makes for a great walk around and indoor lens. I need to go wider more often than closer and 10-22 is a great range to cover. This wide I don&rsquo;t miss IS or a faster aperture, even in low light, and just love shooting with this lens. Once it&rsquo;s on, I seldom reach into my bag for another lens.The fact that there is a new version with STM means you can get a copy of this one cheaper, but maybe that&rsquo;s a point of criticism if you&rsquo;re looking for one.The one real downside is that at the widest there is noticeable distortion which goes away very quickly, completely gone at only 12mm, maybe less. I&rsquo;m not that picky but it&rsquo;s enough for me to call it the only real downside and take away a star.If you are interested in this lens you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="a-beginner-to-rank-amateur-at-best-this-is-the-first-real-lens-i-have">a beginner to rank amateur at best. This is the first real lens I have &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not a professional photographer; a beginner to rank amateur at best. This is the first real lens I have ever owned and I use it on a Canon T5i I purchased last year, my first DSLR. I take about 250-300 pictures a week as part of my profession so a dependable camera body and lens are crucial. This lens delivers a noticeably superior picture quality compared to what I was getting out of the kit lens that came with the T5i and especially compared to the picture quality from my old Canon PowerShot, which was respectable. The colors are vivid and not as flat; the focus is sharper. The wide angle functionality enables me to photograph small areas realistically and I don&rsquo;t particularly notice the barrel distortion until about 13 to 10 mm. That&rsquo;s awesome as I only use such a short focal length in the smallest of spaces; for interior photography I usually play in the 14 to 18 mm range and longer for outdoor photography. This lens is not an uncap and shoot; there is a learning curve. It&rsquo;s taken me over a month just to become comfortable with it. You can always cheat and use the camera&rsquo;s auto setting but you&rsquo;re really missing out. I am having so much fun with this lens I actually look forward to going to work. And I&rsquo;ve learned more about photograph with this lens than ever before.There was one problem. The autofocus malfunctioned after about a month of steady use and I had to drop off the lens to a canon service center in my town. Within two weeks Canon returned the lens with a brand new autofocus motor in it. It works like a charm again. I hope it is fixed for good. I have read elsewhere that the autofocus on this particular lens has been a problem for others. Maybe I should learn how to manual focus and use the autofocus less.Some advice: this is a heavy lens and bigger than you think. Ditch the neck strap and grab a hand strap.</p>
