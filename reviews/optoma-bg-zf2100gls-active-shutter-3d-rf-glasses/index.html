<p>What is a 3D Compatible Projector?
Using the inherent speed of DLP technology, select Optoma projectors can output video and images at an astonishing rate of 120Hz, allowing you to show full screen, full color, stereoscopic 3D. The 3D effect is generated by splitting this signal into two standard video streams, one for each eye. 3D glasses synchronize with the image on screen to filter each stream to the correct eye. Your brain then combines the two streams to make them jump to life. Optoma 3D enabled projectors can only display 3D images when 3D content is delivered to the projector from a PC with software able to generate a 3D image and a graphics card that supports 3D display. Typical applications include 3D computer games, 3D educational software and 3D design and modeling software.
What Hardware and Software is Required to Project a 3D Image?
An Optoma 3D capable projector
Content created in 3D including computer games, educational and CAD programs
A computer with a 120Hz graphics card
A PC compatible with the installed graphics card
DLP Link or similar active lens 3D glasses
Can a 3D Projector be Used to Watch 3D Blu-Ray Discs or 3D Programs Broadcast Via Satellite or Cable?
Currently, Optoma 3D projectors cannot be used to view 3D content from TV broadcast systems or Blu-ray players. Optoma projectors may support these applications in the future but will require additional hardware at an extra cost. After broadcast, Blu-ray and 1080p standards are finalized projectors may be developed to incorporate technology to display 3D video programs without additional hardware. A 3D Blue ray player (1080p) is sending over a large amount of information to the monitor or projector and a new standard HDMI 1.4a connector is required. The projectors do not have an HDMI 1.4a input nor the bandwidth to receive this type of signal. There are several broadcast standards on the horizon and we have not received information about these standards as they are still being finalized so in the interim the only way to process the variety of signals being developed is to develop or purchase a multi-standard box that translates the various signals to work with the projectors. As usual, there are many companies that want to develop their own way of sending the information. The reason that you see bundles being offered now is that Samsung and other companies want to supply customers with at least one working source with their 3D display.</p>

<h5 id="almost-perfect">Almost perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I paired these Optoma 3D RF glasses with my Optoma GT750E 3000 Lumen 720p 3D-Gaming Projector. Here is my experience and the tests I performed:1. Minor issue, less 0.5 stars: They are large enough and do fit over my prescription glasses, though I couldn&rsquo;t wear them as comfortably as I&rsquo;d like to. They were somewhere in the middle, not on my nose neither held by the prescription glasses, they come with 2 nose pieces (instead of 3 as advertised), but neither was useful. Eventually I end up looking at the rim. Actually my Samsung TV 3D glasses (Samsung SSG-3100GB 3D Active Glasses - Black (Only Compatible with 2011 3D TVs)) were the only ones that fit over my prescription glasses perfectly due to the fact that they have some indent on the inner sides of the rim that supports/holds them over prescription ones.2. Ghosting/Crosstalk: I&rsquo;ve tested the glasses with several test patterns specially created for 3D equipment (which I&rsquo;ve used for many other TVs too). Both dark and light scene performance was absolutely perfect - no artefacts, no ghosting, the glasses blocked absolutely everything they should have blocked, each eye saw only the image supposed to be seen by the particular eye. I&rsquo;ve been impressed how the lens blocked the light.3. Peripheral view: works almost perfect. What I mean is some very narrow (abt 1 millimetre in width) area of the lens towards outside and lower edges of the rim causes small crosstalk (5-10% subjective) in dark scenes only. Again, you will notice it if you search for it really hard, you won&rsquo;t be able to see it 99.9% of the time, taking into account that it is a peripheral view area, and a very tiny one.UPDATE: Just to confirm the periperal area issue&hellip; Got 2 more glasses and tested them. Yes, there&rsquo;s a slight crosstalk in the peripheral area, which shows up in extremely dark scenes (as in the third part of my video review).4. Contrast: The glasses showed absolutely the same contrast for the eyes. Great levels of black! The issue is present in cheap 3D glasses - 3DTV Corp DLP-LINK 3D Glasses 2 Pairs for ALL 3D Ready DLP Projectors and ALL Samsung and Mitsubishi DLP TV&rsquo;s and SainSonic SSZ-200DLW 3D Active Rechargeable Shutter Glasses for DLP-Link Projector-White, to name a few.The issue is outlined in my review for 3DTV Corp here:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJQ3FS1MFYRK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004G2VJM6&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=FYI:">http://www.amazon.com/review/R2IJQ3FS1MFYRK/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B004G2VJM6&amp;linkCode=&amp;nodeID=&amp;tag=FYI:</a> Comments contain some interesting info too&hellip;5. Price tag, less 0.5 stars: My opinion may differ from others&rsquo; but for the same price (or lower) you can get a PAIR of other 3D glasses.Overall, I&rsquo;d definitely recommend these glasses to those who are looking for quality picture and the best 3D experience.</p>

<h5 id="fits-over-prescription-glasses-perfect-match-for-optoma-hd33-and-hd8300-projectors">Fits over prescription glasses. Perfect match for Optoma HD33 and HD8300 projectors.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am big guy with big head and I always had a problem with glasses or hats since most of these were too small. This is not a case for BG-ZF2100GLS. These glasses firs perfect and also they fit over my prescription glasses. I have purchased first pair of these glasses to try it with newly purchased Optoma HD33 3D projector. Results were absolutely positive with clear just perfect picture in 3D. So I purchased 2nd pair and these works seamlessly as well. My wife has much smaller head and she find them to be very comfortable as well, I never heard her complaining on these glasses, neither am I. They just perfect fit for both of us.Recently I upgraded my HD33 ot higher model and glasses works with new HD8300 equally perfect. No desynchronization, no crosstalk neither blurr, just clear perfect tridimensional picture. It is a true jaw dropper, so you wont be dissapointed!</p>

<h5 id="better-than-expected-paired-with-hd33-projector">Better than expected! Paired with HD33 projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I researched and read about all I could. Finally decided I would order a pair of these and a pair of the 3D DLP Corp DLP Link Glasses. No contest. I was really pulling for the 3D Corp glasses based solely on price, and they may be a good fit for another projector, I can&rsquo;t say. But I digress.Optoma glasses right out the box were sleek and light weight. I wear rather bulk Rx glasses and these fit over them OK, no major issues. 3D imagery was bright and crisp. While I didn&rsquo;t log a lot of time demoing them against the competition, I didn&rsquo;t notice any eye fatigue or any discomfort from wearing the glasses. I would say they are about as light as the movie theater ones.Two things that I noticed ( and I will call Optoma on the first one) are this. These two things are holding me back from the 5 star ranking1) The 3d in DLP Link mode was FAR better than the 3D in the Vesa or RF mode&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t even close. We tested it on IMAX Under the Sea and my kids thought they were swimming with fish it was that good. So, it sucks paying MORE for a technology (RF) that I may never use. Again, back to the research table and a call to Optoma.2) I&rsquo;m not actually all that crazy about the rechargeable feature&hellip; . Sounds good and all in theory, but what happens if one of the glasses goes out half way through a movie (unlikely maybe due to the long battery life, but you never know)? You can&rsquo;t simply replace an inexpensive battery.. Plus, now if I have 4, 5 or 7 pairs of glasses, I now have to have more room for stuff in an already crowded entertainment center and have enough USB ports to handle the charging. This can be overcome with a little more planning though and that&rsquo;s going to have to do.Summary, good glasses. Comfortable even for a guy who wears eye glasses. However they are pricey and the RF capability doesn&rsquo;t seem to be adding any value in my application. If you are only buying one or two pair, I&rsquo;d say go for it, no questions. However, if you have to outfit a large family, then it may be worth your extra time to review a few different pairs of glasses.UPDATE!! FINAL CONCLUSIONI called Optoma after noticing these glasses worked in the DLP Link mode on my HD33. They said that was impossible&hellip; So, back to the drawing board I went. One more round of testing versus the DLP Corp glasses. I&rsquo;m glad I did one more test. Turns out there is a setting on the HD33 that drastically effected performance, &ldquo;Invert Image&rdquo;. When in DLP Link Mode and Invert is ON these glasses worked, off-no way. When in Vesa Mode and Invert On they were OK, but with invert OFf in Vesa it was even better&hellip; After this testing I gave the DLP Link from 3D Corp another go round. Invert Image effected those as well! When turned off the DLP Link glasses performed just as good as the Optoma, when invert was ON, yuck&hellip;So, in the end who did I pick? I&rsquo;m now going to go with the 3D Corp glasses. While Optoma wins hands down on quality and fit, price is a huge factor. These are twice the price and that makes a difference when outfitting a large family. I am going to leave the 4 star rating because honestly if I only had to buy 1 or 2 pair, I&rsquo;d take these. But I&rsquo;m buying 7, so, different story&hellip; If you are looking for more info on the winner stay tuned I will be posting a review of the DLP Corp glasses soon.</p>

<h5 id="you-may-need-an-emitter">You May need an Emitter!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Please note that no all projectors have an RF emitter built-in. I purchased an Optoma HD25 that works out of the box with DLP-link glasses, but does not have an RF emitter built-in so these glasses will not work without a RF emitter plugged in to the SYNC input on your projector. Even the Amazon site for the projector lists buying these glasses with the Optima HD25 but no emitter! I finally purchased these glasses and the emitter and found the 3D effect to be about the same as DLP-link glasses with the distinct advance of not losing sync as did DLP-link glasses when they were out of line of sight. I could not find another 3rd party brand RF glasses that would work on my Optoma HD25. Please leave a comment if you know of any.</p>
