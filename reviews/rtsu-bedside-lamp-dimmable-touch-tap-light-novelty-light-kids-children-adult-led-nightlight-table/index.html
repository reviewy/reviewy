<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-fine-but-poorly-made">Works fine, but poorly made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this lamp to use when I get up in the night to feed my newborn. It&rsquo;s perfect for that, and works fine! However, it&rsquo;s clearly very cheaply made. It charges via a micro USB cord. The cord is only about 8 inches long, and is very difficult to plug in, both into the lamp itself and into a charging block. It also came with no instructions, so figuring out how to dim and brighten the light took some trial and error.It&rsquo;s perfect for what I need it for, but not a great product quality-wise.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="def-would-buy-again">DEF would buy again!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This light is BRIGHT! or low depending what you need. I love how there are now batteries and you just do a quick charge with the usb. would def buy again and recommend. only thing that sucks was I wanted to attached to my bunk bed (I am deployed) and couldn&rsquo;t because the tape would cover the charging port on the bottom. Would make sense to have it on the side but oh well. Also you know its charging because it turns a very dim red light.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-little-night-light">Great little night light.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very interesting light. We bought this for a cruise since we had an inside cabin and their is not much light to find the bathroom in the middle of the night. Since most cruise ships don&rsquo;t have an outlet in the bathrooms it is impossible to plug a normal night light in. Since the intensity is adjustable you can adjust it down to a very dim light so it doesn&rsquo;t disturb your sleep or blind you when you walk into the bathroom.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-what-i-was-looking-for">Just what I was looking for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Will be traveling quite extensively the remainder of this year, and bought this as a travel light/night light. Fits the bill perfectly; a little bigger than I expected but fits in one hand and very light, easy to pack. I didn&rsquo;t feel the light was glaring - not enough to read by at its brightest, but I planned and do use it at a dimmer level, anyway. Works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-little-light">I love this little light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this little light. It is helpful that it dims and is rechargeable. Perfect for breastfeeding at night. Wish it wasn&rsquo;t as pricey. I think its priced a little high but this little thing works really well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="powerful-little-lamp">powerful little lamp</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lamp is really powerful for how little it is. The only downside is that It feels kind of cheap. I like that it is easy to charge and remembers the brightness setting of when it was last turned on. I command striped it to my wall beside my bed and it&rsquo;s perfect for those midnight diaper changes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="august-and-i-have-always-wanted-a-nursery-nightlight-like-this-for-middle-of-the-night-diaper-changes">&hellip; August and I have always wanted a nursery nightlight like this for middle of the night diaper changes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We are expecting our fifth baby this August and I have always wanted a nursery nightlight like this for middle of the night diaper changes. In the past, I have fumbled around in the dark hoping that I changed the diaper well enough. Looking forward to using this nightlight. It is very easy to use and it dims quite nicely. I hope it is well-made and doesn&rsquo;t break easily. It was made in China so my expectations are a little low.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-convenient">Great product &amp; convenient!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This light has been awesome to have next to the bed. It&rsquo;s small and can be easily carried around if needed. It&rsquo;s easy to use with touch activation and has the convenience of brightening or dimming. Despite the small size, the brightest setting provides a very good amount of light. I was also very pleased with how long it holds a charge. I use it nightly to feed my infant in the middle of the night and only have to charge it once every 2-3 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-nursing-light-for-mommas">Perfect nursing light for mommas</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little thing has a lot of brightness! It dims as well and super easy to use</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-it">Buy it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has changed my life. I use it to check on the baby and have enough light to breastfeed in bed- what a life saver!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cool-tool-for-mommies">Cool tool for mommies</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a cool gadget! I use it to take care of my newborn without waking my spouse. You have to charge it frequently, but I love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
