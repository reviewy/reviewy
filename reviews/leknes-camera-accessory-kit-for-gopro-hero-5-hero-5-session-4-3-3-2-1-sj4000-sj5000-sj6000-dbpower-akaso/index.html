<h5 id="read-this-great-value-for-under-20">READ THIS! Great value for under $20!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works amazing. I would buy again if I needed to. My biggest problem is that the screws and possibly other metal parts are made of a metal that rusts, and I use my gopro primarily for scuba diving. The kit comes with an absurd amount of replacement screws though so it has not been a problem. Also the wrist attachment can snap off in rough waters but to fix the problem I use the included blue wrist strap (like a wiimote strap) always with the wrist attachment in case it snaps off again. Other than that slight problem it is an amazing value for everything you get.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-value-for-money">Amazing value for money!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So we bought a go pro whilst living in Thailand, but Amazon isn&rsquo;t available there and the only option for accessories was the full price go pro ones - so we have been waiting a year to be able to order this!My husband is currently working over seas and he tightened the go pro so tight onto its float that I can&rsquo;t try any of these on until he&rsquo;s home but the fittings look perfectly sized and formed.I was especially excited about the chest strap! We are very active and constantly go bike riding, hiking, snorkling etc. All of the extra mounts and sticky things are very useful to us as my husband hasn&rsquo;t used any of the originals we had as they were like gold dust to him and he didn&rsquo;t want to place one and then regret it- now we can go sticking happy as there are so many!There are sooooo many useful assessoroes in here and that makes it a fantastic value for money!</p>

<h5 id="great-little-set-for-the-price">Great little set for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little set for the price. A few things like the bendy tripod were smaller than I expected, but it is still functional and considering the price a great value. Everything came in decent condition and seems to work with my setup. It is minimum quality but enough. If given the option to buy again, I most likely would still as a base. Some items like the selfie stick and bendy tripod I will eventually replace with more premium, but all the mounts nd such work fine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tons of accessories but no labels. I would recommend labeling with a silver sharpie as in a rush you might not know what is what. It is a great value and has almost every possible configuration.</p>

<h5 id="your-go-to-for-gopro-i-m-in-heaven">Your go to for GOPRO!!!!! I&rsquo;m in heaven</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OH MY GOSH!!!!! I geeked out today! Got my GoPro bundle and holy moly. This thing has everything. I&rsquo;ve had the gopro for a few years and never really used it until I started vlogging and this makes my life so filled.It&rsquo;s got everything you could ever need. I&rsquo;ve already hooked up the bike attachment to my harley! We&rsquo;re going on a few outbacking excursions so the head and chest harnesses are going to rock. But I literally spent like an hour looking at all that was included. I mean, I knew it had a lot&hellip;but this is a frickin&rsquo; beast. Tripod, wrist straps, water floaties, all the stickies&hellip;oh and the outside car mount!!! Already used that for a time lapse!!!Big time awesome</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tons-of-stuff">Tons of stuff!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this for just the chest mount and case, figured those couldn&rsquo;t get too messed up.Very pleasantly surprised at the amount and even quality of the items! If I get another GoPro I will immediately buy another kit.My only &ldquo;complaint&rdquo; is that the safety lanyards are string. I already have several steel cable ones and would have liked to have seen a few included, but definitely not a deal breaker.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-must-have-starter-kit">This is a must have starter kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m impressed with what I got for $17.99.Pros:- So many mounts included.- Carrying case you can stash everything in.- The quality is mostly good with some minor exceptions (see bare minimum wrist mount and flattened foam organizer and foam float in photos), so no big let downs for the price.Cons- No instructions included. I would be happy with even a url to some instructions or a video. It would be nice to have a little guidance with how some of the pieces work. I&rsquo;m still trying to figure out what 2 items are (all the white things in photos) and trying to figure out how to attach the floating back cushion.- The foam in the case and the floating cushion were deformed from shipping (see photos)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-tough-and-great-value-gopro-accessory-set">Very tough and great value GoPro accessory set!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, what a great deal for GoPro accessories. This starter kit comes with basically everything a beginner will ever need and then some.The main ones that I use extensively are the sticky mounts, which worked great on any surface, the yellow floating handle which was a life saver and the head strap which was comfy enough and held secure after ample use. For the price, I&rsquo;d rather buy these generic brand attachments and mounts compared to paying a considerable premium buying the GoPro brand. I really haven&rsquo;t noticed any difference other than my wallet is lighter after shopping directly through GoPro!</p>

<p> I got this for my husband because he just bought a GoPro camera. He likes adventures so he takes his GoPro during those activities. He likes the accessory kit.</p>
