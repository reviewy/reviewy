<h5 id="totally-awesome-saddle">Totally AWESOME saddle!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok, my new saddle, the Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow Women&rsquo;s Bicycle Saddle (Vanox Rails), is AWESOME!!!i think I finally have it adjusted almost right. Might need one more teensy tiny tweak to get it perfect!Did 30 miles today at an average of 13.4 mph. And felt GREAT at the end of the ride! Legs a little tired the last 5 miles, but the awful pains and total exhaustion are gone.I would definitely recommend this saddle to any woman who is having saddle issues!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-every-cent">Worth every cent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I demo-ed 5 saddles from the LBS, all women specific and in the $90-130 price range. My A** wasn&rsquo;t impressed and let me tell you why. I am a small woman, 5&rsquo; 3&rdquo; and 106 pounds and pretty lean in that oh-so-sensitive area. I expect most cyclists are. The Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow has excellent flex on the down stroke in the middle area of the saddle so when your leg is at full extension, the saddle is not pushing back against you and creating pressure. Because of this, I never really feel the saddle beneath me at all, I am at one with it, so to speak, because it moves with me. Whether I am in the dips or up on the bar, this saddle is crazy comfortable.I tend to go on long rides, and spend up to 6 hours at a time on my bike so I really feel like I can give a fair review. I have logged about 200 miles on this particular saddle and LOVE IT. The quality is excellent, and the white leather cleans up very easily with Maybelline Eye Make Up Remover. Try this Saddle, you will not be dissapointed.</p>

<h5 id="nice-ride-but-watch-for-bad-stitching">Nice ride, but watch for bad stitching!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great saddle for the money I spent. I got it for ~$75, which is roughly half of MSRP. I think i know why&hellip; One section of stitching was so rough it was snagging the heck out of my cycling shorts. I wasn&rsquo;t willing to let it ruined all my shorts and I like the way it rides, so I just cut out that few inches of stitching. (It appears to be cosmetic stitching and 60 miles in, I think I am right.) I would&rsquo;ve been super frustrated if the bad stitching came with a $150 dollar purchase, but again I am wondering if that&rsquo;s why it was so much cheaper.Minus that draw back I love it!! Much better than the men&rsquo;s seat that was torturing me which came with my bike. No more numbness.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-thing-since-sliced-bread">Best thing since sliced bread</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best thing since sliced bread&hellip;SERIOUSLY! When I first purchased my Cannondale mtn bike I upgraded the saddle to a womens Terry brand on which I rode many comfortable miles. After losing 50+ pounds my Terry seat became excruciatingly painful. After much research on the internet I realized that I might need a more narrow seat and all the positive reviews pointed me in the direction of the Selle Italia saddle. I am SO GLAD I took the chance!!!! So worth every penny and then some. First ride out resulted in ZERO discomfort. Its perfect for me and will most likely be just as great for anyone with more narrow sit bones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-sit-bones-hurt-so-bad-that-i-couldn-t-do-more-than-5-10-miles">My sit bones hurt so bad that I couldn&rsquo;t do more than 5 -10 miles &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was using the standard seat that came with my Trek. My sit bones hurt so bad that I couldn&rsquo;t do more than 5 -10 miles on my bike. This kept me off the bike which wasn&rsquo;t working for me at all. My daughter recommended this brand of bike seat and WOW! what a difference. I just did a 14 mile ride last weekend and had no pain. I do use Pearl Izumi padded bike shorts as well but I can go much further in much greater comfort than ever before.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-seat-saddle">Awesome seat/saddle!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading the 15 reviews on this saddle, of which 14 were 5 stars, I decided to go ahead and order. I had a long charity ride coming up and knew how my current seat made me feel. OUCH! Although my local bike shop advised against me taking a long ride on a new seat I did it anyway. I did purchase a a carbon fiber seat post and with this new Selle Itailia Diva Gel Flow saddle, the ride turned out perfect. 50 miles without any problems first time to use it. I am so glad that I went ahead and ordered and spent for the 2 day shipping so I could have it on my bike in time for my ride yesterday. FIVE STARS!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-aero-not-so-much-for-hybrid-cyclists">Great for aero, not so much for hybrid cyclists.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a really nice saddle, but not what I needed. It has a decent amount of cushion (gel) in the seat and is nice and narrow at the nose. There was significantly less pressure on the lady parts thanks to the design. The saddle is very light. This seat is for road bikes, and really good for aero position. I did not realize this when I ordered it, as I have a hybrid bike and I never get into aero, this saddle did not work for me. If I do go for a road bike (or a tri bike) and get serious about time, I will definitely get this saddle again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="like-riding-on-a-cloud">Like Riding on a Cloud</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very skeptical at first about this saddle. For a while my stock saddle on my Bianchi (a WTR brand one) was perfectly fine, then I found that the further I was going and the longer I was sitting there the worse it was getting. Especially as I started to lose weight things just stopped being adequate and began to get painful. I tried different shorts and standing more but when I started to get numbness from riding I immediately knew I&rsquo;d have to get a bit more drastic and try a new saddle.I looked around at quite a few, most of which were <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> the price of this one and had good reviews but not great reviews, among the five star ones would be a handful of 3&rsquo;s and 4&rsquo;s that said they did an okay job but still weren&rsquo;t perfect. I decided if I was going to invest in something that I&rsquo;d go with whatever the best was, and it really paid off.Now I can ride for as long as my legs and lungs will allow me without numbness or worrying that I&rsquo;m going to damage something down there. I&rsquo;ve even ridden without my chamois shorts and didn&rsquo;t feel any pain or discomfort. Plus it looks pretty slick on the bike.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>a lot more comfy for drop-bars riders</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-women-s-saddle">Perfect women’s saddle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My go to saddle for comfort. I mountain bike all the time and sometimes for long distances, I only use this saddle on all my bikes</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this seat!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-comfortable">Very comfortable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This seat made all the difference. I&rsquo;m a very happy cyclist now and don&rsquo;t cringe at the idea of a ride over 20 miles. I highly recommend this seat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-saddle-for-some-women">Great saddle for some women</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This saddle wasn&rsquo;t best for me, but I know many women who love the Selle Italia Diva Gel Flow seat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>BEST seat out there for your soft spots, women! If you&rsquo;re not doing triathlons, buy this seat!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-ve-used-this-seat-for-a-month-and-it-s-already">I&rsquo;ve used this seat for a month and it&rsquo;s already &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used this seat for a month and it&rsquo;s already showing wear on the seat as if it&rsquo;s been used for a few years? The surface shouldn&rsquo;t be wearing off after a few weeks of riding</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-more-pain">No more pain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I first put lots of mileage on the Bontrager seat that came with my Trek Madone. It was mediocre like any stock seat. Then I tested a SMP Lady and hated it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bought-for-my-wife-s-bike-she-was-never-a">Bought for my wife&rsquo;s bike. She was never a &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought for my wife&rsquo;s bike. She was never a serious cyclist, but cycles twice a week since I bought this for her. Worth the investment is you (or your lady) will be riding a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-found-my-saddle-great-for-the-low-aggressive-riding-position-as-well">I found my saddle! Great for the low aggressive riding position as well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this seat for my tri-bike after trying some other expensive saddles (including the ISM PN 1.1 Saddle) and I am so glad I did.</p>
