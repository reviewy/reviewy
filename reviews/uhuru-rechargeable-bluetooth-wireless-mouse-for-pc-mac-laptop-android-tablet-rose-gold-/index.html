<p>Color:Rose Gold
Based on customer feedback of last several months, we made some improvements to make the mouse better:</p>

<p>Solution about Connection. There were 5% customers met them. Because No Bluetooth Chip can match more than 1000 Bluetooth drives, after lots of tests we chose the best Bluetooth 3.0 Chip - AIROHA AB1129F. The issues can be reduced from 5% to ≤1%. If any issue, automatically reinstall a new Bluetooth drive can solve it at most times.</p>

<p>Solution about Battery. We adjusted the structure to keep the battery system stable, to prevent it damaged during transport. And we upgraded the battery capacity from 600 to 750 mAh, it can run 2 weeks with 8 hours every day.</p>

<p>Solution about Sleep &amp; Wakeup. We spent much time on the balance between power save and fast wakeup. The mouse will fall asleep after 10 minutes no-operation, when you use it, click any button and waiting 1-3 seconds, it will wake up. If you won&rsquo;t use it for a long time, we suggest you to turn the switch to off for saving battery.</p>

<p>Besides, we also modified the mice edge for more comfortable feeling, changed the scroll wheel for complete noiseless&hellip; We always do our best to improve customer experience. Thanks for choosing UHURU and welcome your reviews.</p>

<h5 id="the-portable-mouse-you-have-been-looking-for">The portable mouse you have been looking for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned no fewer than four bluetooth mouses, and probably a dozen wireless USB ones, including expensive offerings from the likes of Razer and Microsoft, and let me tell you, this is the one to get.If you have ever had a crappy mouse, you know what I mean when I say some are better than others. It&rsquo;s like, some wiggle when you mean to click and then click twice, some click when you didn&rsquo;t mean to, some twitch positions when you click, some have scroll-wheels that seem too fast or too slow or impossible to control, or that make it impossible to middle-click without scrolling a little bit&hellip;Then you add Bluetooth, and Great Odin&rsquo;s Beard, it&rsquo;s like you are asking for a ship of gold just to get a working mouse that doesn&rsquo;t take up a USB port. $60 for a mouse that burns through AA batteries like Charlie Sheen goes through porn stars, weighs half as much as your tablet, and has to be manually re-bluetooth connected if a minute goes by when you forget to wiggle it.This mouse is the right size. You could put it in your front pants pocket and walk around with it all day, no problem, but it also doesn&rsquo;t feel like you are playing with a Barbie dream mouse when it comes time to actually use it. Streamlined is a good word. Hand-sized is another one.This mouse has good &ldquo;action&rdquo;. Back when mice had literal balls and cost real money, this never seemed to be a problem, unless the mouse needed cleaning. But the era of cheap laser mice seems to be full of jerky, crappy, uneven, randomized mouse-movements. Not here. This mouse points where you want it to point. The buttons click quietly and easily, with a resistive haptic &ldquo;bump&rdquo;, not with a loud plastic &ldquo;click&rdquo;. The scroll-wheel has a smooth, high-quality, indented rotation, like dialing a well-made rotary phone. It just feels like the stuff on a luxury car instead of dollar-store junk.This mouse is quiet, stylish, and unobtrusive. Same matte-rubber/synthetic finish as my over-priced Razer mouse, except with better size, shape, form-factor, more reliable operation, and higher-quality operation.This mouse is EXTREMELY lightweight. I mean, like, seriously. If you are carrying a mouse in your shoulder-bag or backpack, this is the one you want. It weighs way less than anything with battery. In fact, it weighs less than a battery.This mouse WORKS GREAT. I leave it on my couch at home, and I take my laptop back and forth to work (where I plug it into a docking station with a USB mouse), to my studio (where it connects to yet another mouse), and to my living room, where this mouse instantly wakes up and begins working flawlessly as soon as both mouse and computer are turned on in the same room. It then continues to work exactly as expected, for as long as my computer is in that room. This is a HUGE DEAL for a bluetooth mouse (and even for some wireless USB mice!). No more un-pairing and repairing, waiting to see if it connects, hoping that this is the last time&hellip; this one just works the way it is supposed to.Last but not least: it&rsquo;s rechargeable, and battery life is great. How many days/hours/weeks does it last? I mean, seriously, it lasts more than I have found out through my extremely unscientific process of just using it as a mouse, and occasionally remembering to plug it into a micro-USB charger every few days or so. Maybe it lasts a week, or a month. I&rsquo;m not sure. It doesn&rsquo;t have a battery indicator, but I would guess that I have used it for at least 15 hours of active mousing between charges, and I have not yet run out of charge. Meaning that the battery life appears to be somewhere north of 15 hours of actively mousing around. I am pretty sure I have left the mouse turned on for well over a week without charging, I am just talking about &ldquo;live&rdquo; computing time.TL;DR: You should get this mouse.</p>

<h5 id="soft-touch-rubber-and-quiet-clicks-make-this-a-great-mouse">Soft-touch rubber and quiet clicks make this a great mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t owned it very long, but this mouse has really impressed me so far. It&rsquo;s about the size and shape of a Magic Mouse, with one key difference - it has a charging port in the front, which seems like a perfectly sensible place for it. It pairs easily (with Mac OS) and does all the things you&rsquo;d expect a bluetooth mouse to do. It&rsquo;s still riding on the first full charge I gave it, seems to intelligently turn off as promised, and wakes up within a few seconds of movement. The DPI button works as advertised and can save you a trip to the mouse travel settings, if you need for your cursor to pick up (or slow down) the pace.But what really got me excited beyond those (still important) factors are the details. The casing is all covered in soft-touch rubber, which feels surprisingly good in the hand. The feel of the scroll wheel is smooth, with tiny bumps in the spin to still indicate incremental changes. And the clicking itself! It has such an understated, muted sound and feel that still conveys plenty of click. Love it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="trying-to-get-it-to-connect-was-too-much-effort">Trying to get it to connect was too much effort</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mouse arrived this morning and I followed all of the directions to a &ldquo;T&rdquo;, but no matter what I tried the mouse just would not connect to my laptop. The Bluetooth capabilities are integrated, so I&rsquo;m not using a Bluetooth adapter. I&rsquo;m giving it 4 starts because I had to fight with it just to get this thing to connect you my Windows 10 laptop. Anything else I have connected to this computer through Bluetooth has connected flawlessly. That wasn&rsquo;t the case here for this product. I like everything about it so far now that it&rsquo;s connected. This mouse is light and easy to hold. Glides easily and even works on my glass desktop where other much more expensive mouse&rsquo;s didn&rsquo;t work at all. So many pluses highly recommended especially if you have small hands like me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="second-one-is-wonderful">Second one is wonderful!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first mouse I received seems to have a sticky scroll wheel and then stopped working. It was only being used as a backup mouse so the return period was long past but after contacting the seller they very quickly sent a replacement. This second one is working just great. I really love the texture of the plastic, the silent click and it is very light. Of course you&rsquo;ll need to do some adjustments in your OS settings to get movements the way you want but that was very easy to do on my Mac. I actually like this mouse better than the magic mouse. If only it had the touchpad scrolling of the Apple mouse but then there don&rsquo;t seem to to be any quite like the magic mouse on the market. For the money this mouse it fabulous. It had no trouble paring with bluetooth and I have moved it between systems with great ease. Recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-i-feel-like-you-have-to-charge-it-a-lot">but I feel like you have to charge it a lot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It does the job, but I feel like you have to charge it a lot. It generally lasts 1-2 days before needing to be charged for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-mouse-for-any-machine">Nice little mouse for any machine.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great and the batter last for a long time with all of the power saving features. I have used it on an Acer laptop and a Surface Book and it worked w/o issues on both.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="feels-nice-in-my">feels nice in my</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Still working ,feels nice in my hand</p>

<h5 id="great-bluetooth-mouse">Great Bluetooth Mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bluetooth mouse. Very low form factor. Does exactly what it should. It was easy to connect to my laptop. Didn&rsquo;t even need the directions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-lightweight-mouse">Great lightweight mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great lightweight mouse. Connects to a device without any issues. Only down side is when you try to connect to another device sometimes it takes a few tries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-sure">Not sure.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not sure how long the charge lasts, or how comfortable, or if it even works well because I constantly have to reconnect to my computer, if it connects at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-for-the-money">Not bad for the money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased 13mo ago, and has been a solid mouse since then, with only minor inconveniences (mostly Bluetooth related) along the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I sent mine back. It never worked</p>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<p>The mouse operates fine, but the USB cable was damaged on arrival. It works with some finagling, but will have to buy a new one sooner than later.</p>
