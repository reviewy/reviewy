Made out of durable aluminum alloy, the mini adapter comes in 3 colors to match the new MacBook 12-inch. It&rsquo;s also compatible with the Chromebook Pixel and other USB-C devices (OnePlus 3 incompatible). For optimal use, use the mini adapter with an uncovered laptop. If your MacBook is covered by a case, the mini adapter may not plug in properly. Do push the adapter hard to the end when you hear the click. Not for micro USB port or mini USB port.</p>

<p>To create top quality smart devices that solves everyday problems.
nonda is a smart hardware startup based in Palo Alto, California. We&rsquo;re a group of smart hardware enthusiasts, app developers, go-getters, and industry specialists. We love what we do and hope to share our vision of what the future of smart hardware will look like with the world. In 2016, two nonda products won the prestigious iF and Reddot Design Awards for best product design.</p>

<p>About the Startup</p>

<p>Describe your product in 3 words.</p>

<p>Sleek. Portable. Durable.</p>

<p>How did you come up with the idea for this product?</p>

<p>When the MacBook 12-inch came out, we loved the concept of a super thin, highly portable working device. But we soon ran into a major problem. We couldn&rsquo;t connect our USB devices to our laptops as we used to, which disrupted our workflow. So we decided to tackle the problem head-on and came up with a solution that we&rsquo;re pretty proud of.</p>

<p>What makes your product special?</p>

<p>We designed the mini adapter to have the same elegant feel and quality as the Apple MacBook 12-inch. It&rsquo;s even constructed from the same aluminum alloy material. Because it&rsquo;s light and compact, the mini adapter provides a working solution that perfectly complements the MacBook&rsquo;s portability.</p>

<p>What has been the best part of your startup experience?</p>

<p>The best startup experience so far has been seeing customers rave about a product that we&rsquo;ve spent months designing, prototyping and testing. It makes it all worthwhile. We get really pumped up by being able to make a difference in someone&rsquo;s day through our product experiences.</p>

<h5 id="must-have-with-2016-macbook-pro">Must have with 2016 MacBook Pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best USB-C to USB-A adapter by far, don&rsquo;t have to deal with having a wire and it&rsquo;s pretty slim. Personally prefer this to the Apple alternative simply because of the compact size. No matter if you want to leave it attached to a certain accessory or take it with you on the go this is a great choice. The LED indicator is a little distracting but since it&rsquo;s reversible you can just face it down also the space gray matches pretty well with the space gray of my computer. Seems to work well with all my USB-A accessories. When plugged in it leaves very little room so use the other USB-C plug on the MacBook Pro though but if you have the touch bar version you also have the other side.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-usb-a-to-c-adapter-on-the-market">The best USB-A to C adapter on the market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is, as far as I know, the only USB-A to USB-C adapter that fits flush with the current crop of MacBook Pros, is made from aluminum, and looks as if it were designed by Apple themselves. Add to that the ability to convert any USB-A device to a USB-C device and you have a winner. Finally, as if that weren&rsquo;t enough, average read and write speeds through this adapter were right up there with native USB-C drives. You&rsquo;re search for an awesome USB-A to C adapter is finally over!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommended-if-you-like-quality">Recommended if You Like Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this so I could use my USB-A trackball on my new MacBook Pro (USB-C). I&rsquo;ve been using it for about a month now. It does the job.It is pricey for an adapter, but it is very unobtrusive. What I like best is that it appears to have a very solid connection - none of that loose-fitting garbage. It seems to be very high quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="brings-what-lacks">Brings what  lacks</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The nonda USB-C to USB Mini Adapter is a simple device which achieves a simple thing. This takes care of what the MacBook Retina lacks, a usable USB-A port. The color matches perfctly. It works perfectly. It looks like it should have came with the laptop. Great price as well! Only improvement would be the availability to charge while using, but that would take away from the simplicity of the device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">Awesome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly, and even lights up to alert user that everything is connected properly. Very small, lightweight, and the color matches my Space Grey MacBook perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-solid-stars">Five solid stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very excellent tool for people having new MacBookPro.I also used it on my Hp Convertible with USB-c and it works like a charm.Highly recommended. I have just ordered another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-i-needed-for-transfer-and-migration">All I needed for transfer and migration</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This tiny adapter allowed me to migrate from my 2011 mbp to my 2016 mbp, and allows me to connect my 3 tb external hd for backups. So it would seem that the 74 bucks worth of cables and adapters they sold me in the Apple store were totally unnecessary. I returned them. This was 10 bucks. If it doesn&rsquo;t last or something goes wrong, I&rsquo;ll update this, but at this time I&rsquo;m very pleased with Nonda (and royally pissed at the Apple store).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-for-the-price">great product for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This adapter fits perfectly in my 2016 MacBook Pro w.o. touchbar. I had no issues using it with my usb phone charger. it fits in perfectly next to my charger. great product for the price!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-a-couple-months-ago-and-it-was-working-great-but-now-it-doesn-t-work-at-all">&hellip; this a couple months ago and it was working great, but now it doesn&rsquo;t work at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this a couple months ago and it was working great, but now it doesn&rsquo;t work at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>very nice</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, no issues. Nice and small too.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="about-half-the-time-it-does-not-work-when-first">About half the time it does not work when first &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>About half the time it does not work when first plugging it in the Macbook. Would have to remove, plug it again, if not work&ndash;then remove, flip it over plug in again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfectly. Low profile.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid">Solid.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid adapter. Great value for the price as it is cheaper than the standard Apple adapter and more aesthetically designed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-a-find">What a find.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These gems have been a blessing&hellip; they work great and are incredibly convenient to have around. Buying two at once made life even easier to jump around and travel with.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-4">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well enough for me! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy-this-for-2017-macbooks">Don&rsquo;t buy this for 2017 MacBooks?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Received this today and immediately went to go transfer files from a flash drive. Does not work. Tried a couple different USB&rsquo;s and even a charging cable and nothing worked.</p>
