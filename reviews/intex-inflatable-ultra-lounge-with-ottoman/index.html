<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="deformed-in-a-couple-months">deformed in a couple months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I heard a couple of loud &ldquo;pops&rdquo; when I wasn&rsquo;t even sitting on it and now its totally deformed and usable. I uploaded a photo of what I am referring to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfortable-extra-seating">Comfortable extra seating</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product! My kids are fighting over it and they love it. The air stays for quite awhile without it deflating. I may have to get another one. We typically use it for family movie night when we need extra seating. It&rsquo;s also very comfortable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-i-was-so-amaze-with-this">I love this! I was so amaze with this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this! I was so amaze with this&hellip; it&rsquo;s perfect for the patio and just so perfect for the front yardThis is great gift too for my mother in law..just in time for her birthdayThe design and style is just so perfecteasy to assemble.Recommendable</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-fine">works fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>haven&rsquo;t had a chance to blow up the chair part yet because I misplaced my air pump, but the ottoman is holding up fine. rules apply to this just as they do with other inflatable furniture. don&rsquo;t over inflate and don&rsquo;t jump on it. then you will have no issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-comfy">Very Comfy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have read reviews of the product not keeping the air which is true I am not sure how to keep it inflated to my liking but it doesnt go completely flat in a day it takes days and all you have to do is fill it up once and awhile in order to keep it the way you would like it. As far as comfort its VERY comfortable, as long as you have the space for the thing its definitely a very big chair it took up half of my bedroom space.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-gamers">Good For Gamers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I seen a lot of reviews about air coming out mine I had no problem just have to make sure the stopper is closed completely . My Son enjoys it while playing on his Xbox</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfortable-lounge-at-a-very-comfortable-price">Comfortable lounge at a very comfortable price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this lounge and the ottoman just seemed like a bonus. It&rsquo;s very cost effective yet does a good job at keeping one comfortable. I ended up purchasing this along with a electric pump so I could inflate the chair easily. I have inflated it and deflated it numerous times and it has never given me any problems.It worked great in my room as my TV is at a higher angle so when laying back on this chair I face up towards my TV..I have found Intex makes some great products and they are never crazy expensive, and that is exactly what I like. Quality products at great prices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="junk">Junk</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Llike a lot of the other neg reviews, it leaks. 1st chair was great for 2 days until it started leaking; never could find leak. The 2nd chair never would fully inflate and I had to keep refilling every couple of hours. Found the leak finally but seeing as how I only had this one for 3 days, its going back for refund. The patch won&rsquo;t stay adhered to the flocking any way. I have an Intex Mattress I use a few days a month. After several months it works just fine. Very disappointed</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-good-at-all">Not good at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not good at all!!! Very poor! Popped in one day.repaired ripped holes and the following day another hole got ripped I would not recommend this for anyone</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-weeks-before-blowout">Three weeks before blowout</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased this for my son who had just moved and had no furniture. In the past, he had moved from one apartment to another at the end of each lease, finding a better place to live&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-pretty-comfortable-and-cool">it&rsquo;s pretty comfortable and cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For what it is, it&rsquo;s pretty comfortable and cool. I inflated it once to about 90% of full, it deflated down to about 80% but it&rsquo;s more comfortable and hasn&rsquo;t lost any air since.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 30 days it leaks at seams</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-chance-with-this-one-its-the-same-problem-like-the-other-reviews-a-small-hole-by-the-left">&hellip; a chance with this one its the same problem like the other reviews a small hole by the left &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Your taking a chance with this one its the same problem like the other reviews a small hole by the left corner I REALLY DONT have MONEY TO waste</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s cheap it’s not worth the money it popped within a week</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="game-chairs">Game chairs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these chairs so we could sit closer to the tv when playing the Nintendo classic &amp; N64. My husband &amp; I love these chairs. They are super comfy for air.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for when I go to moms and watch movies.I even took a couple of naps on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good, heard they will lose air over time if they are over inflated</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="unusable-after-20-days">unusable after 20 days</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had this for literally 20 days, heard a pop, and now it&rsquo;s deformed and not really useable at all. The ottoman works! but this is def not worth any price.</p>
