</ul>

<p>When the sun shines, the 240 Watt Solar panel will produces DC voltage, and the UL approved micro grid tie inverter will change the DC voltage to AC voltage , synchronizing with the utility grid power. It puts out power to the home grid, generating electricity and cutting your electric bill. TWO STEP INSTALLATION: 1. Put the Solar Panel facing the Sun and Plug the cord into your 110V wall socket. Please follow local regulatory electrical codes for installation. If in doubt, consult appropriate licensed contractor. We will send you the specification on solar panel, grid tie inevrter with UL mark, an electrical line diagram. Micro Grid Tie Inverter:efficiency: 95% Temp range: -40° C to 85° C UL1741 certified Lifetime Warranty of 20 years from Readymade Solar: Stackable up to 7 panels</p>

<p>Works Perfect.Don&rsquo;t Plug into UPS or 12volt to 120 volt adapter. Does not work for this&hellip;. I didn&rsquo;t think it would but it was fun to try :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>just put it up,it started to produce power right away.i hooked up a moniter up to it to see how it was doing,it is heavy overcast today,so i only got about 70 - 80 watts out of it,but that seems good for a dark day&hellip;i would recomend this for grid tie.</p>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This system was up and running in 20 minutes. Note that to properly secure this system and dress the cables and do a proper job takes several hours and a little bit of skill and extra hardware that you will need to procure.This system seems to work fine with a GFI (Ground fault) circuit.This is the system to get if you want to tie into the grid. This is not a system for solar power backup. Ensupra has a different system for that.This may look like an expensive system but after the government rebate, this is very affordable.</p>

<h5 id="missing-info-and-some-minor-flaws">Missing info and some minor flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this yesterday, overall quality of the item is good, but whoever put this kit together didn&rsquo;t do good job.1. It came with about 25 feet of solid copper wire, I think 14 gauge,(don&rsquo;t quote me on it though), NOT stranded.2. The wire nuts were used to connect panels to wiring.3. The inverter power input is up to 24V, that should have been in the description.4. The panels are 21volt each, also should have been in description.5. Does not come with any mounting hardware.I had to go out and but stranded wire to install this properly. Since the inverter take up to 24V I cannot use it in serial, to increase voltage (about 40V) so I could use higher gauge wire. I have to use 6awg and that is not cheap.Overall it does what it should, I wish it had more in the description so I can make a better decision before buying.</p>

<h5 id="it-gets-the-job-done-nicely">It gets the Job Done Nicely</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First let me say that I contacted the seller twice, once just after purchasing the product. I was not interested in using the Grid Tie Converter and so my concern was, I wanted to know if I could use the solar panels with a Solar Charge Controller and an inverter in which I learn I can. Just For the record, I contacted the seller twice and he responded, so 2 thumbs up just for that.About the product. I own other solar panels, I own two 45 watt harbor freight 45 watt systems and they are good starter kits, but 45 watts is not a lot of power. But the (2) 120 watt panels from the Ensupra Readymade Solar Power Kit are really wonderful solar panels. I got in a hurry and hooked up my inverter to the panels and it blew up the inverter. This is something you don&rsquo;t do, you must hook up the charge controller and hook up the connection to the charge controller including the battery connections. I did not have a charge controllar that could handle so many amps. I tried the inverter thinking I could hook up a test. Poof and a bang of smoke came out of the Inverter. I blew up my Inverter. This was on a cloudy day and late in the afternoon. A wonderful Product, thanks.The point I am trying to make is that these panels are really great panels, well made and you can&rsquo;t go wrong. Just don&rsquo;t do what I did. Hook up the charge controller and the panel wires to the charge controll and the battery also to the controllar. But a reminder this system is made so you don&rsquo;t need any of that for it ties into your eletric outlet using the Grid Tie Inverter. Thanks. Wonderful, I&rsquo;m Happy! Please don&rsquo;t let the review confuse you, I was doing a diffrent setup.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to set up. Easy to use. Great for educational purposes. Can&rsquo;t be used without an household 120VAC electrical outlet available. This is a &ldquo;grid-tied&rdquo; solar kit, not for standalone applications. 230W is the &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; output power on a bright sunny day, but after conversion efficiency losses, this is only minimal output power, which won&rsquo;t make a big difference in saving electricity, not to mention it can only be used in the daytime. A bit pricey, but at only $2.69/watt not too shabby for a &ldquo;starter kit&rdquo; in solar energy.</p>
