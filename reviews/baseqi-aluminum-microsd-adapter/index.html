<h5 id="when-i-purchased-this-i-was-worried-that-it">When I purchased this, I was worried that it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I purchased this, I was worried that it would not fit my macbook. But it fits perfectly. You can not even notice that this is installed. It has been working perfectly since this was installed. Even after the MAC is put into sleep mode, when the MAC turns back on, it is recognized right away. I have the MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-in-early-2015-retina-macbook-pro-13">Perfect in Early 2015 Retina MacBook Pro 13&rdquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits perfectly in my Early 2015 Retina MacBook Pro 13&rdquo;. I paired this with a 200GB MicroSD card also sold here on Amazon (speed class UHS1), it was seen right away and I setup FileVault and moved my Documents and Photos folders off to the card and turned off journaling to reduce write wear on the MicroSD card. You will want to keep things that change infrequently or not at all on the card. While it is still a magnitude of order slower than the internal PCIe SSD, it is still plenty zippy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-though-once-inserted-it-will-be-more-challenging-to-remove">Great product, though once inserted it will be more challenging to remove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, this is a great product, and it does what it says it does. I take off a star because it isn&rsquo;t easy to remove the item. While there is enough of a indent where you&rsquo;d think you can use your fingernail, you&rsquo;ll likely break it as it needs a bit more strength. This is fine as most aren&rsquo;t removing this frequently (I&rsquo;m not), but there should likely be some tool provided as I do fear jamming things in there and breaking the device or my SD card.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-in-an-aspire">Works great in an Aspire</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it to add another 64 gigabytes to the 32 onboard my Acer Aspire ES1 that has no SATA header. It&rsquo;s much shorter than the card slot, so I had to shove it in far enough so that it won&rsquo;t ever come back out. I&rsquo;m not planning on taking it out though, and it works perfectly fine so I&rsquo;m not complaining. The aluminum frame felt durable and should hold up well if you frequently remove it.If you&rsquo;re planning on buying this for something other than a macbook, you may not be able to get it back out as even the shallower readers in windows laptops tend to be deeper than the macbooks. It&rsquo;s just a card reader, so as long as it physically fits, it should work with any computer. Make sure your drivers work too, as my win 10 ones give me trouble often. If you are upgrading the storage on a windows laptop with those annoying eMMC drives, have a header and don&rsquo;t need the cheapest solution, an SSD would be a better option. But for those that can&rsquo;t have one (like me) these little devices are the way to go!The measurements are .98&rdquo; (width) x .63&rdquo; (depth) x .07&rdquo; (height). 25 x 16 x 2 in millimeters.</p>

<h5 id="having-problems-read-here">HAVING PROBLEMS? Read here:</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EDIT:The photo showing right now showing 4 different adaptor carods is incorrect. I have no idea why BASEQI is tossing away sales, but it&rsquo;s not what you get.Old Review:Ripping fast. Using it with a SanDisk 200gig class 10 card and moving 21 gigs of high resolution video in about 20 minutes with a MBP 13&rdquo; with SSD. A little better than a gigabyte a minute is wonderful. I&rsquo;m using this card: SanDisk Ultra 200GB Micro SD (SDSDQUAN-200G-G4A)HAVING PROBLEMS? Read here:It took me an embarrassingly long time to get it figured out.&ndash;Mount micro SD card text upwards in the same direction as the BaseQi text. The bottom of my BaseQi seemed a little angled but (I suspect that&rsquo;s to keep the card super tight.)&ndash;You probably won&rsquo;t see the drive mount right away, that&rsquo;s okay because you need to RESET your computer.&ndash;That&rsquo;s right, turn it off and back on again, mine was found right away.Less than $100 when it&rsquo;s all said and done and I&rsquo;ve almost doubled my laptop&rsquo;s memory.I use this space as a business-only-storage to keep everything separated. Okay, back to writing books.Good Luck and Have Fun!</p>

<h5 id="fits-like-a-glove">Fits Like a Glove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Installed this with a 200GB mini SD card into my 13 inch Macbook Pro with Retina (early Spring 2015). Works great for extra storage without the bulky nubs of other USB storage devices. Fits nicely into the SD slot, and is undetectable as it sits fully within the slot. Easy to remove with my finger nail.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="expand-your-macbook-storage-with-this-discrete-microsd-adapter">Expand Your MacBook Storage with this Discrete MicroSD Adapter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having an SD card slot on the MacBook Pro means you can always put in a card for additional storage. What I don&rsquo;t like, and I&rsquo;m sure others don&rsquo;t as well, is that an SD card sticks out because there is physically no way to fully insert it so that it&rsquo;s flush against the side.Enter: the BaseQi microSD adapter for the MacBook Pro 13&rdquo;. It makes full use of the SD card slot, but uses a microSD card, which when inserted, will sit flush with the side of your laptop [see photos]. Mine was built slightly off so there is a gap on the right of mine. I guess that&rsquo;s what their &ldquo;precision CNC engineering&rdquo; gets me. I am taking off a star for quality control.— SPEED —Speed-wise, this thing will run as fast as the microSD card you put in. As with most things in life, time is money, and you want to spend your money on the fastest card you can afford so you don&rsquo;t have to spend time waiting for files to transfer when you can be doing other things.— COLOR —In terms of color, the adapter matches-ish with my MacBook Pro with Retina. It&rsquo;s good enough for me, but it could be a better match. No one&rsquo;s going to look at it and say, &ldquo;OMG, that adapter doesn&rsquo;t match their laptop, we cannot sit next to them&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s small enough where it&rsquo;s unlikely someone will notice from afar.— SUMMARY —This microSD adapter does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do—fills the SD slot flush, and makes use of a slot that may otherwise go unused. These days you could easily add significant additional storage with the technology out there. If you buy one of these adapters, make sure you get the right model to match your laptop model. Recommended.</p>

<h5 id="extremely-hard-to-remove">Extremely hard to remove</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as expected, but is not suitable if you really need to use the SD card reader for anything else, I don&rsquo;t have particularly long fingernails, and thus I need a swiss army knife or something like that to remove this adapter every time I need to use the SD card for some other purpose.</p>
