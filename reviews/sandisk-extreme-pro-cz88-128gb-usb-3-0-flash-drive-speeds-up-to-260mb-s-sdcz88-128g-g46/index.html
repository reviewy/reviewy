<h5 id="switch-broke-in-two-weeks">Switch broke in two weeks</h5>

<p>I mainly bought this for its speed and decent price/GB. But I was skeptical about the &ldquo;sophisticated design&rdquo; with the ability to extend and retract the plug. It just seemed like a gimmick to me. USB plugs are pretty bombproof so I&rsquo;d prefer a simpler design with no moving parts. But there aren&rsquo;t too many options in this capacity so I bought it anyway.Well it has only been two weeks and the switch on my drive already broke. I can slide it back and forth but the USB plug no longer fully retracts into the casing&hellip;it gets stuck halfway. Fortunately, if I slide the switch all the way forward, the plug locks in place so I can still use the drive, but it is a bit disappointing. I always treat my equipment with care, so it&rsquo;s not as if I was abusing it. I expected better durability from such a high-end stick.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Update Sep 9, 2014As per Andrew&rsquo;s comment, I contacted SanDisk. After explaining that I had not abused the product, they agreed to replace it. I received the replacement drive a couple weeks later and it works perfectly! Hopefully the broken switch was just a fluke. Increased rating to 4 stars since SanDisk resolved my problem and it really is a great drive.</p>

<h5 id="improved-casing-but-no-performance-improvement">Improved casing, but no performance improvement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for some time for Sandisk to make 128GB version of their Extreme USB 3.0 flash drives, and I was exited when I saw their announcement of the exact drive I was waiting for with seemingly improved casing.I&rsquo;ve found the all plastic casing of the non-pro version to be the sole but glaring weakness as the 64GB drive I bought before promptly had its USB plugged bent up, breaking a couple of leads. This pro version, however, seems to be in much sturdier casing, and there definitely is a lot less play with the moving parts even though the flash drive still has a lot of plastic parts. It still is roughly the same size as the non-pro version, so it can still be be too wide and fat for a USB port, depending on what else is plugged in next. On the other hand, the part where you can put a lanyard loop is aluminum, so I&rsquo;d feel comfortable putting this on a key chain.That said, the performance doesn&rsquo;t quite meet the 260MB/s Read and 240MB/s Write performance claim on the product page, but rather its performance is pretty much on par with Extreme 64GB flash drive. Below is the CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 x64 benchmark result with the drive plugged into Intel USB 3.0 host bus off Z77 chipset.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;Sequential Read : 199.627 MB/sSequential Write : 194.830 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 153.001 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 18.204 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 11.440 MB/s [ 2793.0 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 10.854 MB/s [ 2649.9 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 9.948 MB/s [ 2428.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 11.126 MB/s [ 2716.2 IOPS]I&rsquo;m mostly happy that they finally upgraded the flimsy casing on the non-pro extreme drive, but I can&rsquo;t help but be a bit disappointed that they didn&rsquo;t improve the performance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>ABSTRACT:Overall, the SanDisk Extreme Pro CZ88 128GB USB 3.0 has a deserved high rating. However, you&rsquo;ll see that some users were very disappointed. Both users are right.As the seller has commented several times, the configuration of the PC it&rsquo;s connected too has alot to do with transfer speed, but I didn&rsquo;t see the BIGGEST factor mentioned, the type of transfer you’re doing: sequential/random, single/multi- threaded,and large/tiny file sizes.My testing platform was an ASUS N501VW laptop with a 512 GB SSD drive rated at around 500+mb/s and a USB 3.0 port. A highly recommended laptop that won&rsquo;t serve as a bottleneck in these tests. The software was CrystalDiskMark.To cut to the summary, large sequential transfers are VERY fast. When transferring video files of 1-2 gigabytes, I achieved around 200-250mb/s write speeds, just shy of the specs advertised by Sandisk, though they have a line in the listing that says <sup>420</sup>&frasl;<sub>380</sub> which is b.s. Random transfers of smaller files, nonsequential, were MUCH slower. When backing up a small 1.5 GB windows user profile, which had multiple tiny files, I barely got 50 mb/s. In the old days, you would have heard you’re hard disk thrashing to get to all the far flung sectors – the definition of random or nonsequential read/writes.TESTING:I’ve attached test data from the CrystalDiskMark speed test:(1) The first pic is my laptop’s SSD drive. You can see its VERY FAST on sequential and small file transfers. Its only slowdown is single-threaded 4K transfers, but multi-threaded/multi-queue transfers are the norm, so who cares? Otherwise, it&rsquo;s 500+mb/s and much more, depending on the transfer type.(2)The second pic is the SanDisk Extreme Pro CZ88 128GB USB 3.0 Flash drive. You can see its fast on 1 GB file transfers. It&rsquo;s not up to specs here, but ~200mb/s is fast. HOWEVER, you can also see that 4k Q32T1 is MUCH slower and 4k, single threaded random operations are just as painfully slow at &lt;10MB/s. (A legend I placed at the end of this review defines each test)SUMMARY:Reading/Writing nonsequential small files is going to be disappointingly slow for some. The thing is, most flash drives have this limitation, so it’s not a defect. If you are backing up your profile daily and you want speed, a slightly more expensive SSD might suit your needs better. SSDs are much faster at nonsequential read/write and small files. That pretty much defines user profiles that contain tiny data files and that are often randomly written over time.But for movie buffs, large media content or medium work files, this is one of the fastest flash transfer rates you can get. It&rsquo;s fine for transferring medium sized files (~100+mb) to shuttle around and gets faster the larger the single file (usually sequential).I&rsquo;m planning on using a larger SSD for my external backup drive, but I love this for shuttling movies, photos, spreadsheets, and the like (medium to large files).The bottom line is that this is a great flash drive, only limited by being a flash. SSD external drives are the Cadillac, but this little truck is one of the best in its class for quickly loading/unloading medium/large file size groups – Photos, Music and Movies would be the obvious example for home users. Fine for spreadsheets and word docs, just not AppData and the like you accumulate on the internet and from applications storing tiny files in your profile.Buy it if you need a flash drive, and rest assured it&rsquo;s one of the fastest. Otherwise, get an more expensive external USB 3.0 or USB-C (3.1) SSD. The latter is the best of the best if you have the port and the $$$.Hope this helps clarify the disparate experiences people are having.Legend:• All : All Test (&ldquo;Seq Q32T1&rdquo;, &ldquo;4K Q32T1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Seq&rdquo;, &ldquo;4K&rdquo; )• Seq Q32T1: Sequential (Block Size=128KiB) Read/Write with multi Queues &amp; Threads• 4K Q32T1: Random 4KiB Read/Write with multi Queues &amp; Threads• Seq: Sequential (Block Size=1MiB) Read/Write with single Thread• 4K: Random 4KiB Read Write with single Queue &amp; Thread</p>
