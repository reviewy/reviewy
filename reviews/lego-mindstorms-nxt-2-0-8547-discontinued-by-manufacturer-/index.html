Build, Program, Go
Creating a MINDSTORMS robot is challenging &ndash; but not too difficult &ndash; with an illustrated step-by-step booklet and software showing the way. The booklet gives you instructions for building a basic &ldquo;Quick Start&rdquo; robot only, which is an easy introduction to the MINDSTORMS experience. This robot took our two adult testers about 30 minutes to build and 30 minutes to program. After that, they spent a lot of time just playing with their creation and testing its abilities.
Once you master the basics of MINDSTORMS, you&rsquo;ll need to use the included software to get instructions for more advanced creations. You can also use the MINDSTORMS web site to find instructions for many other robots, or you can create robots on your own. No matter what you choose to create, the principles are the same: just build the robot using the LEGO elements in the kit, and program it on your computer using the software. Then watch your robot come alive.</p>

<p>NXT Technology Brings LEGO to Life
MINDSTORMS NXT 2.0 features the latest in robotic technology: an advanced programmable microcontroller, Interactive Servo Motors, smart sensors, icon-based drag-and-drop programming software, interactive challenges, and wireless Blue tooth and USB connections &ndash; all the smart technologies you need to create your custom robot.</p>

<p>First, the brain of the MINDSTORMS robot is NXT, an intelligent, computer-controlled LEGO brick that features a 32-bit microprocessor, a large matrix display, input and output ports, and a speaker.</p>

<p>Second, three Interactive Servo Motors give you precise control over the robot and ensure that the robot moves with precision &ndash; the built-in rotation sensor can measure one-degree steps.</p>

<p>Third, there are four robotic sensors. The first is the Ultrasonic Sensor, one of two sensors that gives your robot vision. You can use it to make your robot avoid obstacles, sense and measure distance, and detect movement.</p>

<p>And fourth of all, two Touch Sensors give your robot a sense of touch. They detect when they are being pressed or released, and you can use them to make your robot pick up things or act on command. For example, by pressing a Touch Sensor you can make your robot walk, talk, close a door, or turn off your TV.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a Color Sensor that functions three ways: it distinguishes colors &ndash; black and white, as well as a range of bright and pastel colors &ndash; it distinguishes light settings, and it can be used as a color lamp.</p>

<p>And finally, the MINDSTORMS Software lets you program your robot. Use the software to create a program, and then download the program to the NXT by using the USB cable or the wireless Blue tooth connection. Mac- and PC-compatible drag-and-drop software gives you 16 building and programming challenges, from beginner to expert.</p>

<p>Overall, this set scores an excellent rating for its clever design elements. Our testers enjoyed the way the set brought a new level of interaction to their LEGO experience, and appreciated how easy it was to create their first robot. They also loved the way this set encourages inventive play &ndash; all the cool hardware that makes up the set can be used to build any robot you dream up. Finally, our testers liked how this set offers a great balance of learning and fun, and encourages interest in science, computers, and engineering.</p>

<h5 id="must-have-kit">Must Have Kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had the Lego Mindstorms kits ever since they started coming out and they have never disappointed. I wish they were a little cheaper so more kids, young adults and adults could get their hands on them as they are a great way to be introduced to robotics, programming, electronics and many other things not to mention just pure mental stimulation and creativity.I was clearing stuff out of the house and had decided to sell my kits on the well known online auction site. Within months I had the urge to do more with the kit and ended up buying one again :). If you can swing the cost you really should, especially if it is for a child that has interest in this type of product. The learning and fun are nearly unlimited!</p>

<h5 id="mac-users-need-this-workaround">Mac users need this workaround</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is an unfortunate Flash compatibility issue with Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard) and 10.7 (Lion). I have NOT been able to repair it using any of the patches available. Other suggested solutions have included downgrading to Flash 9 or running Windows on a virtual machine. Until this is fixed, here is the simplest workaround:Issue: The NXT 2.0 software crashes on Mac computers when using the instruction guide pane.Solution: Download images of the building instructions and use the rest of the software as normal. The programming guide and program builder should still work as advertised- the crash issue is only with the building instructions. The illustrated building guides can be found by searching &ldquo;robogator building instructions&rdquo; under image search. These instructions include all 4 of the models advertised on the Mindstorms box, which someone created from screen grabs of the software (the PDF instructions on the Lego site are out of date). It was a life saver for us! (It also contains instructions for programming the bots on Linux.)It&rsquo;s worth noting also that the product only comes with instructions for half of the first model, and not with instructions for Alpha Rex or any of the other illustrations on the box. This is understandably frustrating for those of us having software issues.Hope this helps! I would have given the product 4 stars if the software worked or user support was better. I&rsquo;m planning to buy one of the beginner guidebooks as a companion to this toy.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-introduction-to-patience-following-detailed-instructions-and-robotics">Excellent Introduction to Patience, Following Detailed Instructions, and Robotics</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Mindstorms NXT 2.0 is a great toy! Packaging was perfect - the first thing we did was count every part and mark it off on the parts list. Nothing missing!! In fact we got one extra piece. The directions for assembling the robots were remarkably clear and detailed. Once in a while I wish the camera angle was a little different, but (to see more detail in a particular place) this did not stop us from successfully building all four designs. One extremely important piece of advice is, work together with someone and have them check <em>each</em> assembly step you complete. There are many tiny pieces and if you are off by even just one hole, you will end up having to disassemble all the work completed until you find your error. That&rsquo;s why I suggest having a partner help you. Unless you are the type that is extremely fastidious and re-check every assembly step. But the real fun begins once you have built the examples provided with the purchase. With those four designs under your belt, now you can move on to whatever else your imagination can envision. Oh, and by the way, the programming interface is National Instruments &ldquo;Lab Views&rdquo;, which is (in simple terms) a graphical method to do object oriented design. If you have ever priced Lab Views for an engineering application, you&rsquo;ll see that it costs between $1k to over $5k. So how Lego managed to get Lab Views as their programming language in a robot that costs only about $350, I really do not know. Finally, if you build all the models that came with the kit, there are plenty of forums where you can browse designs submitted by others. And if, along the way, your child (or you) learn some robotics and/or design and programming skills, it&rsquo;s a win-win situation! Don&rsquo;t hesitate, go for it! You won&rsquo;t regret it for a minute.</p>

<h5 id="for-robotics-class">For Robotics Class</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband leads a class at the local homeschool co-op and we purchased two of these sets to use as the main course of the class. The children absolutely love the set. This thing can be programed to talk, recognize colors, respond to light changes or to bump and turn. Several project ideas and plans are included with very detailed instructions that can be brought up on the computer or printed out in booklet form. More plans and projects can be found on various internet sites. This is a must-have for any Lego and Robot enthusiast (even though it is pricey).</p>

<h5 id="lego-mindstorms-nxt-meet-os-x-lion">LEGO Mindstorms NXT meet OS X Lion</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have acquired three Lego NXT sets over the recent years. Too be honest, the Mac OS X Snow Leopard support for the bundled MINDSTORMS NXT-G software has been problematic. The new OS X Lion which defaults to a 64-bit system mode increases the level of the challenge.Determined to find a &ldquo;good&rdquo; OS X solution, I investigated several options. Ultimately, I found a solution which (1) does not use Adobe Flash, (2) has a most recent NXT Firmware &hellip; ahead of LEGO&rsquo;s release, (3) an updated Mac OS X to NXT communications drivers and (4) does not require Parallels.This basic solution is to use National Instruments LabVIEW. LabVIEW is the core technology licensed by LEGO Group for use within the bundled MINDSTORMS software. Also, LabVIEW is a good stepping stone to professional grade tools (i.e. better career path training for kids than NXT-G.)Like MINDSTORMS NXT-G, LabVIEW is a graphical programming environment. If you want Java or C-like programming, then search for leJOS and NXC on the web. However, be advised that leJOS and NXC are more for serious programmers.More details from my experience installing Lego NXT on OS X Lion are here: [&hellip;]&ldquo;Sometimes we stare so long at a door that is closing that we see too late the one that is open.&rdquo; ~ Alexander Graham Bell ~</p>
