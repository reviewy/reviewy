<h4 id="product-specifications">Product Specifications</h4>

<ul>
<li>Versatile panel securely hides small AV streaming devices and TV accessories behind TV. Just don&rsquo;t put your burner phone back there, we don&rsquo;t vouch for that.</li>
<li>We support your decision&hellip; to hide your streaming devices&hellip;well, up to 3 lbs. That&rsquo;s more than enough for your Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV, and others.</li>
<li>Includes two hook and loop straps to secure accessory to panel. And no, the hook and loop is not a 4th down trick play.</li>
<li>Did you think this was going to just float in space? All hardware is included to attach panel to a TV or TV mount.</li>

<li><p>We can work together to achieve a common goal. This streaming device mount doesn&rsquo;t just work with all ECHOGEAR TV Mounts and Stands, but all TV mounts and TVs on the market.</p>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>So you got rid of cable (bravo fellow cord cutter), but now your media streaming device is still taking up space on a shelf below your TV. With the ECHOGEAR Streaming Device Mount, you can simply and securely attach your device to the back of the TV out of sight. With a 3lb weight capacity and universal design, this mount can support almost any device.</p>

<p>Compatible Devices:</p>

<p>Roku 2
Roku 3
Roku 4
Roku Express
Roku Express+
Roku Premiere
Roku Premiere+
Roku Ultra
Apple TV 1st Generation
Apple TV 2nd Generation
Apple TV 3rd Generation
Apple TV 4th Generation
Amazon Fire TV
TiVo Mini</p>

<p>Having universal streaming device mount is the best option for many reasons. Let&rsquo;s say you buy an Apple TV with a mount made specifically for this year&rsquo;s Apple TV model. Cool, right? Well, what happens when you want to upgrade to the newest model or switch to a Roku and it&rsquo;s a different size? That means buying another mount, throwing the old one away, and installing again. Talk about a pain.</p>

<p>By purchasing a universal mount, any time you change or upgrade devices, you can save money and save yourself from another install process. Now you don&rsquo;t need to be shy about upgrading to the newest Amazon Fire TV, it&rsquo;s pretty sweet.</p>

<p>Built with you in mind, this streaming device mount is compatible with every TV and mount out there. Just screw it into the existing VESA hole, attach any device with the included strap, plug the Roku in, and binge watch Silicon Valley.</p>

<p>With Echogear you also get US-based customer service available 7 days a week to help in case you have questions or just need someone to talk to. We&rsquo;re here for you, and since we&rsquo;re from Minnesota, we&rsquo;re extra nice.</p>

<h5 id="not-ideal-for-wall-mounted-tvs">Not ideal for wall-mounted TVs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, you can use it to attach a streaming device to a wall-mounted TV.But it&rsquo;s better designed to attach a small device to the back of a TV that has wall-mounting holes but is sitting on feet that don&rsquo;t use them.The bracket attaches to just one screw of the standard VESA mount on the back of the TV. If you&rsquo;re using a wall mount, it slides between the TV and the mount. Your TV will be slightly skewed relative to the mount as a result, because one of the four mounting points will have the extra thickness of the bracket to deal with. It would be better if the mount attached to two of the VESA screw holes, or included a set of washers the same thickness as the bracket to even things out.While you CAN use the bracket to attach a TiVo Mini to a TV, it doesn&rsquo;t fit very well. The bracket is just a bit small for that, and the included straps, while innovative and sturdy, take up a fair amount of space as well.So, it works okay, but there&rsquo;s room for improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-nice-item-have-two">Really nice item. Have two.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have two of these that I use for either a Fire TV box or the other one I use with a Raspberry Pi Zero + accessories. The straps they come with are handy, but I found that certain items work better with zip ties (as you can see in the photos). Comes with a ton of screws and spacers. Everything you would need really. My only gripe, and its not a big one, is I wish there was more of a flush fit with the back of the TV. As it is, there is a bit of space that this thing just kind of hangs with. Not a big deal at all, just weird. The price could stand to be a bit lower, but it&rsquo;s very niche so I get it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-solid-mounting-unit-overall">A solid mounting unit overall&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My TV and device for the job were a Samsung UN75H6350 75-Inch (2014 Model) and Roku 4K Ultra. A solid mounting unit overall. The system came in the box with 6 different size Philips head screws and various washers and spacers to accommodate multiple configurations. Instructions were clearly illustrated and explained in English (as in: first language English). The mounting holes on my TV (table mounted) were too wide so I could only secure the panel using a single hole, which still turned out plenty tight enough. The included hardware contained a screw (M8x20). The provided strap downs were intuitive and ratcheted down my device, super tight. The mounting design was flexible installing my Roku 4K Ultra vertically. I was doubly pleased being able to use both provided straps. No worries the ECHOGEAR will be in place for years.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-with-apple-tv-mounts-and-ethernet-switches-and-wifi-waps">Works with Apple TV mounts and Ethernet Switches and WiFi WAPs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great idea and has allowed me to hide the numerous internet connected gadgets that were popping up around my Flat Screen TV. My Apple TV is attached with the Latest Apple TV 4 - Apple TV 4th Generation Wall Mount and my ethernet switch and WiFi WAP. Would like it to be just a little bigger to attache even more devices, but overall it&rsquo;s great. I bought two - one on the left and one on the right side of the back of the TV.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-versatile-mount">Great versatile mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to mount a TiVo Mini. The mini does cover most of the surface, but there should be enough holes distributed across the mount to find a way to attach it to your tv/monitor. I was able to use the included screws to attach mine to the old stand location which meant I didn’t have to remove the wall mounting bracket.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-hassle-to-mount">A Hassle to Mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needs to be made clear that you have to unmount your TV to use this device</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-product-works-as-advertised">Excellent product. Works as advertised.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product. Works as advertised. It helped me hide all the wires for home theater in my bedroom which includes cable box and Fire stick.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality">Good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality mount. I returned it because if compatibility issues with my TV mount</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-bad-overall-industrial-velcro-better">Not bad overall, industrial velcro better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is good, but industrial velcro on the back of the TV works too and is less of a hassle to install.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-a-tivo-mini">Perfect for a Tivo Mini.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A perfect fit for a Tivo Mini. Very easy to install and well made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not as sturdy as it could be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-product-i-put-my-roku-and-gramafon-on">Fantastic product. I put my Roku and Gramafon on &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic product. I put my Roku and Gramafon on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does what it claims. I use it to mount a secondary DirecTV receiver behind the TV</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars-1">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had no use for it after mounting my TV</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-like-a-charm">Worked like a charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well. I wanted to put more than 1 product on the back of the tv and would have liked a couple of additional clips.Nice design on the Velcro clips</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This really keeps your TV area clutter-free.</p>
