<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="not-only-for-brooms-mops">Not Only For Brooms &amp; Mops!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used it to mount my lightsabers and it worked perfectly</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="why-didn-t-i-buy-this-sooner">Why didn&rsquo;t I buy this sooner?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a small apartment and the broom closet was always a mess with the brooms hitting me in the face whenever I took the trash out. This saved me so much stress! The slots have little rollers and they move to fit just about any size mop or broom. There are also little hooks that can drop down if you want to hold towels or the dust pan, which is what I use it for. This is a must-have organizational tool!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-idea-it-helps-organize-things-and-get-them-off-the-floor">A good idea, it helps organize things and get them off the floor&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The wall mounted holder works well, nothing slides down (so far) and the storage seems secure. My only suggestion to make this a 5-star product would be to have a small tab to push up the spring mounted arms that hold your items in place. I don&rsquo;t have an issue loading or unloading a handle, but my Wife does. She complains that the springs are too strong (but they need to be). She can get things out of the organizer but leaves me to put them back :) . Rather than use the supplied hardware I used wallboard anchors that are a bit more substantial. With six of these holding up the Mop and Broom holder, it&rsquo;s not going anywhere. We purchased two organizers: one to mount one behind the door to the laundry/mud room for mops, booms, a hardwood floor sweeper and a yard stick. The second will go in my garage to store a broom, scrub brush, paint roller handles and a push-broom. It&rsquo;s difficult to see it on the product photos on Amazon but there are also six flip down hooks, they aren&rsquo;t heavy duty but rather a nice place to hang light-weight items. If you are looking for a way to get similar items off your floors and out of corners, this has item has met my expectations and then some.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The picture is accurate. You can easily hold 5 items that have a long handle (thing a mop or broom) if you do what the picture says (some items have the handle pointing up, others need to go the opposite direction). The unit itself is made of plastic and is not particularly heavy. However, it comes with 6 mounting screws as well as the drywall plastic thing (meaning you don&rsquo;t have to mount it into a stud). For mine, four of my screws were used with the drywall thing while I coincidentally hit a stud for the other two (the screws go in pairs one over top of the other). It took me 10 minutes to install. I drilled pilot holes so as not to mess up my drywall. This product is as advertised.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="finally-my-laundry-room-is-organized">Finally&hellip;.my laundry room is organized!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally, my brooms, mops, dust pan, and swiffer are organized!Appearance:-The color is a bit drab - between a biege and a grey, but it looks just fine.Quality:-The product is a very solid plastic which should hold up for many years.-It included 2 extra rubber replacement pieces for the holders in case they wear out (which I doubt will happen before we end up losing them).Installation:-There are 3 screw holes.-The package includes the screws and drywall mounts.-Make sure you mount it right sided up or else it won&rsquo;t hold the mops and brooms.-Using a level to make sure it&rsquo;s straight is probably good, but not necessary.-Takes about 10 mins to install.Use:-I was able to hang a swiffer broom, a regular broom, and two mops on the holder without any issue.-There are 2 hooks which pull out from the front. I hung a dust pan and broom on those hooks.This product works great to store mops and brooms. I would recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First time I have had our brooms &amp; mops organized for years. Much better that others I have tried. Was impressed with the quality of the product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-space-saver-easy-to-install">Perfect space saver easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Got this for brooms etc to store in my laundry room. Needed to save some space once we got larger washer and dryers. This was easy to put up, my hubby was done in about 15min. We had all our parts You have to stack things correctly so your broom and mop bottoms don&rsquo;t interfere with each other. You need a little muscle to push the broom in, but it means that it does not move. No sliding or slipping. My mom doesn&rsquo;t like that she has to snap it in there that hard (she is older) but it does not bother us. I either alternate- some up some down- or you have to alternate the heights. The hooks are ok, but the way we have them its hard to hook things (or dryer blocks it) so we use them to hook our Swiffer because it has a curved handle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-little-kitchen-supply-holder">Sturdy little kitchen supply holder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this kit to use on the back of my pantry door to hold mops, brooms, and other cleaning supplies. It came as pictures but was a little more cream colored than white, which I was ok with since it is not like I am using it as decor.The only thing I really didn&rsquo;t like was the screws that came with it to mount. They were so large, if I used them they would have went straight through the door to the other side. I get needing bigger screws to keep it up, but that length just seemed unnecessary especially since most people I know that have these have them mounted to the inside of a door.Overall I am pleased, even if I&rsquo;m not able to use all pieces that came along with my purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these holders at different times. They installed easily and hold firmly. I put them behind doors. Inexpensive compared. Would buy more if needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cleaning-supplies-kept-neat-tidy">Cleaning Supplies Kept Neat &amp; Tidy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fixture is a great addition to our utility room. Dust mops, brooms, whisks, dustpans, and buffing clothes deserve a tidy home of their own when they’re not working and this&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-perfect-place-to-put-our-brooms-and-mop">The perfect place to put our brooms and mop</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The perfect place to put our brooms and mop. It wasn&rsquo;t hard to hang, and it keeps everything neat and organized.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product. Very useful storage option for small spaces.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the job, however the plastic material is. But cheap.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="got-me-organized">Got me Organized</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for organizing your mops/brooms. Would be better if at least on slot could hold larger handles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just as advertised. Works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="gets-all-the-handles-out-of-the-way-and-the-hooks-are-an-awesome-addition">Gets all the handles out of the way and the hooks are an awesome addition.</h5>

<p>Now a permanent fixture in our laundry room. Gets all the handles out of the way and the hooks are an awesome addition.</p>
