<h5 id="sleek-quiet-and-overall-great-product">Sleek, Quiet and Overall Great Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this unit. I&rsquo;ve had it for 6 months now and was compelled to write a review after reading some negative commentary. The unit is extremely sleek and very quiet. I have a smaller kitchen and installed it under the kitchen sink. I can easily fit a variety of dishes. I was very thorough in reading the instruction manual and adjusted the settings to account for my area&rsquo;s water hardness and followed all the recommendations to a T. My dishes are cleaned beautifully each and every time. Highly recommend for those in tight spaces or who can&rsquo;t afford to run plumbing lines to other areas of the kitchen. If I had the room for it I would have installed the double stacked units.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-a-motorhome">Great for a motorhome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband wanted this dishwasher in our motorhome. We are fulltime RVers, meaning we live and work in our RV. I cook, he washes dishes. He installed it himself but finding all the right fittings was frustrating and took several trips to Lowes and Home Depot. Reason, there are no directions for the special fittings needed that do not come with the dishwasher. It did come with 2 small dents in the front stainless steel door which I wasn&rsquo;t happy about. I did not attempt to send it back because it is a huge, palleted shipment covered with foram and plastic and just to get it repacked and shipped back would have been expensive and difficult just to lift it out of the motorhome and into our SUV. So, I am living with the small dents. On the positive side, it is so quiet we don&rsquo;t even know it is running most of the time. The only negative is sometimes the wash detergent tablet dissolves and sometimes it doesn&rsquo;t. We then have to rewash. Haven&rsquo;t figured out why yet as we are placing it correctly. It has several cycles to choose from, some quite long. The quicker wash works for us most of the time. It does hold a lot of dishes even though it is drawer sized. We have had it in about 2 weeks now and I do enjoy having clean dishes with dirty ones out of the way and done in no time. I have several friends that have them and they enjoy theirs too. That&rsquo;s why my husband wanted one.</p>

<h5 id="great-dishwasher">Great dishwasher!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works wonderfully!! Put it in our bar and washes glasses spotless. Very happy :) Be sure to read instructions though, to learn how you cannot place dishes, and correct usage. It is not like my full size kitchen dishwasher.</p>

<h5 id="love-my-dish-drawers">Love my dish drawers!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>[Update: As of February 2017, at 12 years old, I&rsquo;ve never needed a repair on either of my two dish drawers. Couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with this purchase.]I purchased two Fisher Paykel dishwasher drawers in 2005. Mine has been completely trouble free from day of installation. I&rsquo;ve never had to call for a repair or maintenance. I understand others have had problems, but wanted to give the other side. I have two drawers of the same size, one above the other. My kitchen design didn&rsquo;t allow for the option of both drawers being in the top position, one on either side of the sink, but I think that&rsquo;s a great option since you never have to bend over to load or unload. I&rsquo;m single, so it&rsquo;s a more practical and environmentally sound to have the smaller, individual tubs, rather than a standard, full-size dishwasher. I fill one up every couple of days or so. It runs quietly, as do most modern dishwashers. Not as virtually silent as some I&rsquo;ve heard, but still makes very little noise. I&rsquo;ve had no problems with its cleaning ability. A friend with the same model keeps complaining, but every time we talk about it, she admits to using detergent that is specifically NOT recommended by the manual and doesn&rsquo;t use a rinse agent. I use good quality powder detergent and keep the rinse agent dispenser filled (it lasts a long time) and my dishes and glasses come out sparkling clean and spot free. I had to start adding LemiShine a year or two ago, after all detergents had to be reformulated to be phosphate free, by law. I was getting hard water deposits and a film. I blamed the dishwasher, but when I called the local dealer for a repair call they told me about the change in detergent formulas mandated by law and said many people thought their dishwashers had stopped working well. They recommended the LemiShine additive and my dishes and glassware are back to being sparkling clean. It completely eliminated any hard water film inside the dishwasher, too. I can easily fit my rather large dinner plates, so those complaining about that must have unusually large plates. No, I can&rsquo;t fit oversized platters nor large cutting boards. I&rsquo;m happy to wash those by hand. One minor complaint is the filter that must be occasionally removed and cleaned. No big deal and I tend to rinse before loading, so mine rarely needs cleaned. If you are used to NOT rinsing before loading, you&rsquo;ll have to clean it regularly. For me, the compromises were well worth it. I can run a small load every couple of days and not feel like I&rsquo;m wasting water and energy, like I would with a full-size dishwasher run half full.I&rsquo;ve been thrilled with my dishwasher drawers for 8 years now!</p>

<p>I love the drawer style dishwasher. It fits my small kitchen perfectly with space to spare for a drawer beneath. It is the quietest dishwasher I have ever had. I highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="great-in-our-rv-good-product">Great in our RV! Good product!</h5>

<p>We bought this for our 2014 RV and we installed it ourselves. It&rsquo;s great!!! The install was not hard and it&rsquo;s awesome. I don&rsquo;t like doing dishes and now I don&rsquo;t have to. We were happy to give up the storage for this. Good product.</p>

<h5 id="make-sure-your-cabinet-maker-knows-the-height-you-are-getting">Make sure your cabinet maker knows the height you are getting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is about the only option you can get if you want a dishwasher (or a dishDrawer as they call it) in a media room bar area. Anything else looks just too big and wrong. There are 2 styles of these &ndash; a model number DD24S (what I have and am reviewing) and a model DD24D. That last D/S deals with the product depth, I believe. Mine is 16&rdquo; tall. The guy making cabinets for me used the wrong dimensions and made an 18&rdquo; opening (I think for the D model) &ndash; but that has turned out to be better. I put a 2&rdquo; spacer inbetween the lower drawer and the dishdrawer and that has the right visual appeal. Go for this model, a 9&rdquo; tall drawer underneath, and 3-4&rdquo; of dead space between the 2 to define it. It just looks right.As far as the washing goes &ndash; a bit quirky. There is a small space to put your dish tablet / powder in, but it has these funny prongs in it and you can&rsquo;t pierce your tablet, so you have to put the tablet in the utensil rack. Also it is slow like a regular dishwasher. A normal load with heated dry takes 120 minutes.</p>
