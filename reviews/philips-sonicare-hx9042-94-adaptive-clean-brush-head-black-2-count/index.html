The Philips Sonicare Adaptive Clean is Sonicare`s deepest cleaning brush head. Designed to work with multiple Philips Sonicare toothbrush models, these Snap-On replacement brush heads have flexing sides that contour to your teeth and gums for 4X more surface contact and up to 10x more plaque removal vs. a manual toothbrush. Reminder bristles fade to let you know when it&rsquo;s time for replacement. Replace your brush head every three months as recommended by the American Dental Association.</p>

<h5 id="quality-control-issue-or-perhaps-a-knock-off-of-philips">Quality Control Issue or Perhaps a Knock-off of Philips</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, with only a couple of uses the bristles have fallen apart.Not just on one or two, but every single one; which is a total of 4.In a valiant attempt to purchase the softest toothbrush head available, I have experienced difficult results leading to a unusable product.Not sure or believe these were made officially by Philips or if they were a good knock-off.Perhaps, they were sitting for a long time in a warehouse with scorching heat.As every other Philips head I have purchased in the past have well lasted over the time prior to replacement.In my situation, what occurs is the first of the many bristles break off at the top and begin to progressively make it&rsquo;s way to the middle.Leaving only half as many bristles; which causes the brushing not to be completed properly.I was unable to return; as I purchased these right before leaving the country for work and wouldn&rsquo;t have made it back the US in time and didn&rsquo;t bother. Nonetheless, I thought it be wise to at least warn others that not all Philips heads are created equal.If this review was helpful to you in anyway, please let me know&hellip;It&rsquo;s my honest opinion and like to believe I have helped others with choosing the right products based on my own experience.</p>

<h5 id="way-better-than-diamondclean">Way better than diamondclean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are amazing. I have always used the diamondclean and they never did me wrong, but these are engineered for an electric toothbrush so much better. First off, the transparent blue you see on the head of the brush is actually made of rubber, so if you happen to knock it against one of your teeth while it&rsquo;s on, it wont make that horrible hard plastic to tooth vibrating sound and make you jump.Second of all, the rubber holds on little groups of bristles and because the rubber on the actual bristle part of the head isn&rsquo;t held by anything, it has more freedom of movement from the vibrations. (provided a picture to better explain it).My teeth feel super clean after brushing, maybe it&rsquo;s just because of the different head I need to get adjusted to, but it feels better than the diamondclean ever did. I would 100% recommend this.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-the-way-this-brushes-and-cleans-but-after-about">I love the way this brushes and cleans… but after about &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am torn. I love the way this brushes and cleans… but after about two weeks the little bristle clumps fall out! Now, I was thinking this could be a faulty batch, so I bought another set from target… no same thing. Then I got a set of the black version. Same thing again. It is too bad because it cleans so well! I shall be going back to the diamond clean (is that the name lol) when the last brush goes bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="in-a-good-way-i-was-a-little-skeptical-regarding-the-price">(in a good way) I was a little skeptical regarding the price &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These things are crazy!! (in a good way) I was a little skeptical regarding the price initially, but after using them a couple of times, I think they would be still a good value at twice the price.. I had been using some of the third party compatible brushes and I definitely will not switch back to those even though they were quite affordable. Using these is a totally different experience, not as harsh on the gums, but superior in cleaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-brushheads">The Best Brushheads</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Sonicare brushheads are a revelation. They have this revolutionary design idea where, by using a semi-flexible silicone material to build just the tip of the brushhead, they&rsquo;ve made the bristles move more than the usual sonicare brush. So it almost turns your sonicare into more of a hybrid of a Sonicare and a Oral-B (the ones where the bristles actually move back and forth). The cleaning effect is, in my personal experience, the best of both worlds. I just can&rsquo;t believe these are so hard to find &ndash; none of my local pharmacies have these Adaptive Clean brushheads! And I also love that they are bigger &ndash; they brush more of your teeth at a time. Try them, you&rsquo;ll never go back to the other types.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-diamond-clean">Better than Diamond Clean</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW! Have a Diamond Claen base and was quite happy with the performance of the Diamond Clean brushes. According to Phillips the Adaptive Clean brush cleans better. Yes, it really does. It is much better than the excellent Diamond Clean. It is backward compatible with most Sonicare bases. If it fits your base, it is a no brainer. You want this brushhead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="each-brush-head-fell-apart-in-the-first-week-of">Each brush head fell apart in the first week of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Each brush head fell apart in the first week of use. Not typical of Sonicare quality. I don&rsquo;t know if BuyBelowSale was selling seconds or knock-off&rsquo;s, but these didn&rsquo;t seem to be the real deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cleaning-brush">Great cleaning brush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are working well so far. They seem to get in between the teeth a little better and they are bigger than the diamondclean brushes. They are just a little too big width wise. They go past the size of the tooth. Also I like the older style brush protector that slipped on. This clip on style isn&rsquo;t as sturdy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>😀</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="contrary-to-popular-reviews-mine-did-not-break-into-pieces">Contrary to popular reviews, mine did not break into pieces.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well. I hope I am getting a deep clean. Next appointment with the dentist would tell. But it did not break with regular use so I am happy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worthless-fall-apart-within-6-weeks">Worthless! Fall apart within 6 weeks.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;d give these toothbrushes a zero if that were an option. This was a replacement set for my first pair which within 6 weeks BOTH toothbrushes had had several individual brushes&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love my Sonicare tooth brush. Accssories on Amazon are better priced than on the Philips website.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-but-too-pricey">Great !! But too pricey !!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these for my sonicare. but a little pricey. I will try a less cheaper one from Sonicare next time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-good">Really good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know much about toothbrushes, or technical specifications etc. but I do know that when I use this brush head, my teeth and gums feel really, really clean.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-really-like-this-head">So far really like this head</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far really like this head. Makes my teeth feel cleaner. My husband prefers a different one. Hopefully these last.</p>

<p>Great toothbrush heads</p>

<h5 id="superior-clean-you-can-truly-feel">Superior clean you can truly feel</h5>

<p>Superior clean you can truly feel! Only con I have is the vibrations can be too much where it causes splatter over your mouth and the mirror.</p>
