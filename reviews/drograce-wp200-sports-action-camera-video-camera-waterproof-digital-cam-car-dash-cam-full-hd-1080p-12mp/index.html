<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera works exactly as advertised. The 1080 x 60 fps is quite acceptable (to me). It does everything I need it to do without any hassles.All in all, for the price, a wonderful product. taking into account the price difference, this little camera seems to me to be a worthwhile purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t a GoPro, but a great value for the price.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<h5 id="sports-camera">sports camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Since I like mountain biking and outdoor activities but I’d rather not spending too much money on a camera, I bought this sports camera to record my outdoor life. The thing you may need to pay attention on is that this camera accepts chips for less than 64GB, if you have a 32GB or 16GB that’s perfect. Overall, the first expression of this camera is compact. To explain, its size is relatively small and easy to carry. I could easily hold it in my hands while I am recording. If I were riding a bike and couldn’t hold it in hands. I normally tight it on my chest using the chest band that came with the camera. Also, the outfit of this camera is neat. For example, it has fewer buttons which makes recording more simple and easy to control. Overall, it is a decent product with this low price.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<p>works wonderful cant wait to have my child use it on the mtn snowboarding this year</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-camera-for-all-events">Best camera for all events!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first decided to get this camera I expected a decent, fun little new toy.What I got, however, was an incredible device with impeccable photo quality, excellent durability (you can see some pictures I took in this post, all underwater, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll agree that the quality of this camera compared to the price that you pay for it is an amazing deal.)I am absolutely IN LOVE! Now I have a really awesome camera to use and show off to all of my friends! Definitely will be using it all the time from here on out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cam-for-the-money-and-lots-of-fun">Great cam for the money and lots of fun.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been looking at cams like the gopro but didn&rsquo;t want to spend the money as this is my grandsons first cam, this was very low in price but so far so good It works great. My Grandson has been using it on his bike and he even took it in the kiddy pool (no leaks). It takes a nice pic and when he used on his bike the movie looked very stable. It is easy to charge and came with the waterproof housing, you can also get other additional accessories. He loves putting videos on YouTube that he has taken with this. Nest we are going to take it skiing with us to see how that works out. It&rsquo;s been a lot of fun and something that we can use together.</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-waterproof-12mp-camera-camcorder-several-features">Great quality waterproof 12MP camera &amp; camcorder ~ several features &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality waterproof 12MP camera &amp; camcorder ~ several features ~ at a good priceOne thing I didn&rsquo;t realize in the listing until I went back to the pictures was shown in # 3 at left of listing.It shows this records with loop recording &amp; acts like a dash cam in your car on the windshield.Keep in your car like this can use for recording like a dash cam + have it handy if you need to take pictures.This is a great thing because the quality of the picture &amp; recording is excellent compared to some others that are grainy.I had really initially looked at this for the price being a less expensive waterproof camera/camcorder which would be good as extra camera.I haven&rsquo;t set it up this way yet but was thinking it would be good to have in car that way it could record all the time &amp; have it handy.I thought it would make a good travel camera/camcorder so if it was lost or damaged wouldn&rsquo;t be a big loss.It comes with a strap, USB cable &amp; so many other accessories.This would make a good gift for my brother that travels.It is so small compared to other cameras &amp; unlike my camera that isn&rsquo;t working because it got stuck this won&rsquo;t have that same issue.It&rsquo;s easy to use &amp; waterproof so can actually go underwater 30 meters with it.Comes with a 16 page illustrated &amp; easy to understand user manual but print is very small which I encounter with many manuals.Cons:The battery is 900 mAh so that means 90 minutes of recording time. It would be good if I could get an extra battery that had higher mAh to use along with this one as that would allow more time to record &amp; take pics. I&rsquo;ve read there&rsquo;s no issue with getting a higher mAh on a battery as long as it has the same output. Having an extra battery would be a good thing as you can use a higher mAh then if it runs out of battery or vice versa. If one got lost you&rsquo;d always have a backup one too. I don&rsquo;t know exactly what the price is as I need to figure out what&rsquo;ll work.It does not have a SD card included &amp; can&rsquo;t use over 32GB (that is the max) but the cards are cheap &amp; if needing more (like if on a trip) could just buy an extra. Otherwise if you use the 32GB &amp; then transfer the pics you just erase &amp; start again.12MP isn&rsquo;t as high as some MP but I had a 20MP camera that doesn&rsquo;t work because the lens is now stuck which the picture quality was not as good as this.</p>

<h5 id="3-big-problems-with-this-camera-love-the-camera-otherwise">3 BIG problems with this camera. Love the camera otherwise.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like the camera very much, but&hellip;.. three problems related to the purchase:1. Amazon makes it impossible to contact the Seller to obtain simple information.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-for-price-very-basic-quality">Excellent for price, very basic quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is still pretty clear that the build quality on this is very low, and the picture quality is rather bad as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it">Worth it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t had much time to spend on this one. But, I did run a test on it very quickly when I received it. All appears in good working order.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-only-thing-i-don-t-like-is-it-will-only-accept-up-to-a-32gb">The only thing I don&rsquo;t like is it will only accept up to a 32gb &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works really well. My wife and I bought it as a dash cam for a +5,000 mile road trip, and it held up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-buy">Do not buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s very poor in video quality terrible interface it&rsquo;s just a shell no good spend more money get a better camera I fell for the review smh</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-waste-your-time">Don&rsquo;t Waste your time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case is the best thing about this cheap lil camera. The picture &ldquo;quality&rdquo; is horrible. Not as advertised! They are not HD.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing">AMAZING</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is so great! I just went hiking to test it out and I love it!! I also love the packaging how it&rsquo;s so neat! Will be buying more for my brothers 💓</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-cool">It is cool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No SD card</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-worth-it-for-the-price">Well worth it for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price of this product, it is excellent. There are times when you start to record but the video freezes but you can just stop the recording and start it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for an action camera for a trip. After reading numerous reviews on several action cameras I decided to purchase this.</p>
