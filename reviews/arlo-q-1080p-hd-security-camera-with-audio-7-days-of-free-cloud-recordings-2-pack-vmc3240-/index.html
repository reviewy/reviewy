<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good-nanny-cam-not-so-much-if-you-need-continuous-recording">Good nanny cam, not so much if you need continuous recording..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall I like this camera, it fulfill the need I have and I think the app and web page are perfect. Clean and easy to understand, that helps if you&rsquo;re not tech savvy.My dislikes goes in the limitation to not record stream, and I wish you could have more than one device connected, so I don&rsquo;t get blocked when someone is already checking the video.The image is great, the sound captured is pretty decent, I can hear everything easily and it also have a speaker that I never used.Good support with IFTTT, I have an applet setup that when my main door open, the camera records for 30 seconds, which works every time.I think if you just need to keep track of movements and sounds, this is the camera for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="returning-connection-issues">Returning- Connection issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good picture quality. Terrible ability to connect. I&rsquo;ve used 3 different web browsers and constantly have trouble connecting. Once it does connect, it&rsquo;s great. It also has trouble connecting on my Android. It seems the issue is with Flash, but it&rsquo;s absurd they can&rsquo;t work these bugs out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-happy-with-these">Very happy with these.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been using these for several months now. Aside from the occasional manual reboot these have been very reliable useful and hands off. The software has it quirks and learning curve but all the needed features are there and more all are pretty easy to set once you find them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-was-pretty-accurate-will-be-buying-again-for-our-own">It was pretty accurate. Will be buying again for our own &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought to help monitor a relatives house while out of town. Worked very well. It would message me for any motion or sound detected. It was pretty accurate. Will be buying again for our own house. I prefer this over our current Nest cam because any activity detected will be saved for at least a week for free. With Nest cam - fee starts after 1 month trial.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camera">Great Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good quality surveillance camera system. The only issue is the connectivity tends to be poor as the distance from the WiFi gets further but even within the stated distance</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-value-for-the-price">Excellent Value for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered a packag of two. It took me 5 minutes to set up each. Camera has many settings to customize for individual need. I would highly recommend this camera. The only drawback is that you are only able to save to their server. But it can also be looked at as a good thing, if you get robbed, the videos are safely away from your home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cameras">Great cameras</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have had these for a few months now, they are very easy to install, very sensitive to sound and movement and have an easy to use app interface. The cameras provide a high quality image and also have good night sight ability when the lights are off. It&rsquo;s an added layer of security on the house and well worth the price. I ended up purchasing 3 more because these Arlo cams functioned so well, Arlo allows you to have up to 5 cameras networked without a monthly charge. Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-better-choice-unless-your-last-name-is-duracell">The better choice unless your last name is Duracell.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Switched to the Q after a couple of years spending a fortune on batteries with the original Arlo system. Great option if being completely wireless is not a requirement for you.My only complaint is the fact that each Arlo Q camera is managed independently. Wish there was a way to group them together for quicker/easier management. Geofencing in inconsistent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="work-well-easy-to-set-up-app">Work well, easy to set up app</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They were very easy to set up and they work well. Integration was simple with my iPhone. QR code scan and boom&hellip;done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-resolution">Great Resolution</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not the easiest to set up, but not the most difficult either. I cannot talk through the camera. but I&rsquo;m happy with the resolution and love the magnetized bases.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-bought-a-package-of-2-and-one-failed-after">I bought a package of 2 and one failed after &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a package of 2 and one failed after a month and the other requires almost daily rebooting. looking for another system</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-camera-works-fine-in-a-garage-and-linked-without-problems-to-the">The camera works fine in a garage and linked without problems to the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two the devices. The camera works fine in a garage and linked without problems to the Echo Show and to my computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cameras-and-app-regularly-fails">Cameras and App Regularly Fails</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve owned these cameras for a year now and have had nothing but trouble with them. They regularly fail to record motion no matter what sensitivity they are set to.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-but-not-yet-great">Good but Not Yet Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great cameras only wish the could read a license plate from the driveway. Not quite crisp enough for that unless the camera is 10ft from the car.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-but-not-without-flaws">Decent but not without flaws.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cameras mostly do their job. The installation/set up was very easy. I&rsquo;ve rarely had a problem with the cameras not picking up wifi or going off line.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="camera-works-great-microphone-is-very-sensitive-and-picks-up-the">Camera works great. Microphone is very sensitive and picks up the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera works great. Microphone is very sensitive and picks up the silghtest noise. You can only turn it off and on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-good-with-some-practice">Works Good with Some Practice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good camera system, although it came with no instructions. Setup can be challenging and took longer than I expected based on my experience with the wireless Arlo&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-only-cameras-i-ll-use-because-of-the-free-7-day-monitoring">The only cameras i&rsquo;ll use because of the free 7 day monitoring</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great cameras, I cant think of any negatives. It is SUPER easy to setup, its the only camera in the world with free 7 day monitoring and cloud storage.</p>
