<p>Works great, outputs 5.33V/433Mah DC in direct sunlight. Have it wired into a usb step up transformer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C93Z8JY/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C93Z8JY/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a>) in order to power a usb battery pack. Takes an absurdly long time to charge, but that&rsquo;s my fault for trying to use one on its own when it should be two wired in parallel (433Mah as opposed to ~1Ah). If you&rsquo;re going to try and power any form of usb powered device with this, get two (There&rsquo;s a two pack available here: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Allpowers-500mah-Charger-Panels-Battery/dp/B00H4MKD2M/ref=aag_m_pw_dp?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A18M12GR6V2Z8F)Update:">http://www.amazon.com/Allpowers-500mah-Charger-Panels-Battery/dp/B00H4MKD2M/ref=aag_m_pw_dp?ie=UTF8&amp;m=A18M12GR6V2Z8F)Update:</a> Bought a second panel. Wired in parallel, I&rsquo;m getting 1.1 amps at 6 volts. A 75 cent 1N4004 diode from radioshack brought the voltage back down to 5v, and all is working well.</p>

<h5 id="nice-little-solar-cell">Nice little solar cell</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bright shiny small solar cell. Well packed, with a clear protective film on the front that needs to be peeled off before you can actually use it.There are two solder pads on the back of the solar cell. I soldered half a USB cable to the pads so that I had a female USB to connect to. Easy to solder to, but be sure to fasten your leads securely with either tape or glue so they do not pull at the solder pads while in use.Yesterday morning in a moderate overcast I got about 0.3 W from the solar cell. This increased to about 2.25 W closer to noon when the sun broke through the clouds for a short period; that is much closer to the claimed power output than I expected. This morning, with a heavier overcast that threatened rain I got about 0.12 W.The output of the solar cell is very dependent on lighting conditions and your power draw. Open circuit voltage seems to be between 5 and 5.5 V, but that number doesn&rsquo;t really matter. When actually pulling power from the solar cell, the output voltage drops significantly - I generally saw 3.5 to a little less than 5 V under load. You can control voltage by limiting load, but the best approach is to add a boost converter to maintain the required voltage under load. If you are powering a standard USB device (e.g. cell phone), a boost converter may be all you need; for more complicated applications you may need to add a battery and charging circuit to maintain continuous operation.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>so far so good. i bought 1 and it was not enough to power and charge my ESP8266-01 so i bought 2 more and that seems to be working out not really 100% sure i just hook it all up today but will test it out and see what happens</p>

<p>received product In a timely manner, everything was packed to ensure no possible damage. all you need is a soldering iron and you&rsquo;re ready to start your DIY project.Made a solar tablet/battery pack charger for when I go camping, cheaper and can&rsquo;t go wrong with learning a thing or two!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-solar-cell-charger">Excellent (solar cell) charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome solar energy tool! It exceeds my expectations. It peered up my battery pack well in one full days And I assume if used fluently (everyday?) could probably make up the cost from saving on home energy costs! My only quibble is I wish this quality of product (company brand) was collapsible to carry. I&rsquo;ve reviewed all other collapsible so jar cells and they don&rsquo;t seem to have anywhere close to the charging power and most don&rsquo;t have the proper connection feeds</p>

<h5 id="it-works-nice-performance">it works, nice performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>they work, connected them in series and have a constant 10.2-10.8 volt reading in my regulator at full sunlight and it dips to about 8v with some clouds, perfect for powering an arduino project.</p>

<h5 id="i-gotta-give-it-5-stars">I gotta give it 5 Stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;d be great if these things could do more, but for the purpose these are nice and pretty efficient.I received the item and it was in perfect condition. The back has two little spots for smacking a Multimeter on it and measuring the output. I dragged it around the house and measured the different outputs. Just sitting in my living room (with very little natural light), I was able to get 2.5-3.5vDC pretty consistently. That&rsquo;s nice. I put it in direct sunlight and it output 5+vDC. Nice!My plan is to create a self-sufficient lil&rsquo; charger for my portable devices. Let&rsquo;s face it, it&rsquo;d be nice to have that for any situation that requires this. Like the review that mentioned you&rsquo;ll need 2 of these &hellip; yep, you&rsquo;ll most-likely need 2 or more. I&rsquo;m on it! Sure, I could purchase a solar powered charger, but that&rsquo;s not what I want to do. Wanna build one myself. 20 bucks and I can swap out the pieces as needed or even add more &hellip; you get the point.Pretty straight forward if this is your plan. This lil&rsquo; guy is roughly 6&rdquo;x5&rdquo;. Link the two Solar cells (or more) together accordingly and (in my plan) connect it to a Cigarette Lighter to USB-style charger. Simply plug in your Mobile device and let it charge. Nothing difficult at all. Is it perfect? Of course not. Will it work in a pinch? That&rsquo;s the goal. With some double-sided sticky tape, some light soldering and a Cigarette Adapter &hellip; You&rsquo;re good to go.I&rsquo;d definitely recommend and I plan on buying quite a few more of these and expanding my cute lil&rsquo; project. We should all begin doing so. Re-usable power.READ MORE</p>
