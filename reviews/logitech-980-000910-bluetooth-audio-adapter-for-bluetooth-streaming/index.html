<blockquote>
<p>This unit has RCA holes&hellip;that means instead of hooking up a cd player or tape deck&hellip;you hook this up to the back of your receiver&hellip;then pair it to your phone&rsquo;s music player and Jam!&hellip;I had a thousand dollars worth of old gear in the garage and it wasn&rsquo;t being used&hellip;this works great&hellip;hope this helps some old school folks that don&rsquo;t know you can do this&hellip;sounds so much better than most of the crappy little wireless speakers the kids are buying..</p>

<h5 id="great-buy-with-litte-to-complan">Great buy with litte to complan.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After trying two other products (AmazonBasics Bluetooth 4.0 Audio Receiver(ok,need line of sight and cuts out after 25ft) &amp; HomeSpot NFC-Enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System(It&rsquo;s bad, cuts out if you are 20ft and need line of sight ) First off, this product @ $21 is MUCH better than the other two. It can safely stream line of sight or not for 25ft(line of sight cut outs started happening beyond 25ft). I had no problems with cut outs going around the bend in other rooms on the same floor as long as it was within the magically 25ft range. The sound quality was unbelievable. It was like I was wired in. Great highs lows and mid range. Now the bad part.; You will have to disconnect the device after you are finished streaming music because if you don&rsquo;t you will get no sound(text alerts,message recordings,etc) from your iphone iOS 9.35 device because it is sending it to the receiver. It did not go near the 50ft range it said it would go. It&rsquo;s not low power(no big deal for me). It&rsquo;s bluetooth 3 which might be the reason why it is better than the other two. If I would have gotten a better range it would have been 5 stars. Cheers !!!</p>

<h5 id="be-prepared-for-very-loud-beeps-even-at-3am">Be prepared for VERY LOUD beeps. Even at 3am.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Others have mentioned it. I want to reinforce it. This device makes a series of VERY LOUD beeps every time a device (like your phone) connects or disconnects. This happens when you leave its range, leave the house, return to range/house, or (and this is most important) RANDOMLY at all hours of the day. There are times when my phone is 2 feet from this receiver and the signal drops and then immediately connects. 6 loud tones follow. That is annoying. You know what is really annoying? When it happens AT 3AM AND WAKES UP THE WHOLE HOUSE. You can&rsquo;t just disconnect it from your phone either, as it seems to automatically reconnect later. You only have three options:1) Forget the device on your phone2) Unplug the receiver3) Turn off your phone&rsquo;s bluetoothAll 3 options defeat the purpose of the device. And no, it is not possible to turn off the beeps. You can confirm this yourself by visiting the brief instruction manual online. Needless to say, I have buyer&rsquo;s remorse.</p>

<h5 id="work-good-on-windows-10-tablet">Work good on Windows 10 tablet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Bluetooth music receiver work really well on my Windows Tablet. I am using Lenovo MiiX 2 8 Windows 10. This tablet is connected to Plugable Pro 8 Docking Station so I can use it like a desktop. My large TV, USB keyboard/mouse and Landline are connected to the Plugable Pro 8 but Pro 8 has an audio issues. Plugable has no fix for it and pointing fingers at Windows 10. I don’t have time for these company pointing fingers at each other and we are stuck in the middle of their stupidity. I bought this Bluetooth receiver and connected to my home stereo and paired it to my Tablet.</p>

<h5 id="this-logitech-is-needy-always-looking-to-connect-to-your-device">This Logitech is needy, always looking to connect to your device</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a bluetooth adapter and it does that just fine. Here&rsquo;s the problem, or at least a problem for me: It connects automatically. Actually, &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t the right way to put it&hellip;it strong-arms all other Bluetooth connections and pushes them out of the way. It hijacks any other connection and overrides it. Ok, that&rsquo;s being dramatic- but here&rsquo;s what it does: Connected to any other Bluetooth device and then come within broadcast reach of this unit? This unit will connect and boot you from the other connection. Connect to my Bluetooth speaker, listening to music&hellip;then all of a sudden, my phone will connect to this Logitech instead. In my car listening to music over the bluetooth connection&hellip;pull into the drive way, and suddenly I&rsquo;m no longer listening to music because my phone has paired with this Logitech in the house. The Logitech is always looking to connect. Even if you don&rsquo;t connect to anything else, your phone is automatically connecting to this Logictech, and so all of the sound on your phone stops working unless you turn Bluetooth off.That&rsquo;s pretty annoying. As a result, when I&rsquo;m done using this unit I have to &ldquo;forget bluetooth device&rdquo; on my phone, otherwise it will just keep trying to connect to this one. I suppose I could turn off this Logitech when I don&rsquo;t want to use it, except there&rsquo;s no on/off switch - so you&rsquo;d have to unplug the Logitech, but that&rsquo;s a bit of a pain and I shouldn&rsquo;t have to. The idea when I bought this Logitech was to have it hooked up to my primary stereo in the living room - an old school stereo before Bluetooth was around. When I want to listen through my big stereo, I connect to this Logitech. When I don&rsquo;t want to listen to the big stereo, I disconnect and I connect to something else&hellip;or to nothing. But that&rsquo;s not an option - the Logitech always wants to automatically connect to any device that it&rsquo;s paired to. None of my other Bluetooth devices do this with exception of the car, but it makes sense to do that in the car because it&rsquo;s only on when the car is on, and you can safely assume that when the car is on you want your phone to connect with the car&rsquo;s Bluetooth.Anyway..it&rsquo;s a pain, and it means you have to either unplug this Logitech, or unpair it (aka, forget the pairing) on your phone every time. If I had known that, I would have purchased a different model.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-more-than-happy-with-the-quality-of-it">I am more than happy with the quality of it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered some KRK studio monitors and wanted to listen to them wire-free so I did some research and found this product. I am more than happy with the quality of it, it provides very clean sound and pairs to your device within seconds unlike some other bluetooth devices. Attached is a picture of the setup, notice you probably can&rsquo;t see the bluetooth adapter very well because its taped to the back of the dresser and still works perfect.</p>
