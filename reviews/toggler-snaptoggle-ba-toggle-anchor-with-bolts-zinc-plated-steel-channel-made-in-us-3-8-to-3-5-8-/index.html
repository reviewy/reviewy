<h4 id="product-specifications">Product Specifications</h4>

<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4>

<p>The TOGGLER SNAPTOGGLE BA toggle anchor provides a secure hold from within various hollow materials <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; to 3-<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub>&rdquo; thick including gypsum board, drywall, and concrete block, includes <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo;-24 UNC-threaded bolts, and is made in USA. The anchor channel will not rotate when installing the bolt, whether installing by hand or with a screw gun, and will stay in place if the bolt is removed to facilitate fixture and screw changes. If using bolts other than those supplied, the anchor accepts <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo;-24 UNC metal bolts with a minimum length equal to the thickness of the item being fastened and the thickness of the mounting material plus <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo;. The SNAPTOGGLE anchor meets Federal Specification FF-B-588-D for Type V anchors.</p>

<p>The anchor consists of a corrosion-resistant zinc-plated steel anchor channel that inserts through a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; drilled hole in walls, ceilings, or floors and installs against the back side of the mounting material; plastic straps attached to the channel that position it into place; and a plastic cap that slides down the straps and presses into the drilled hole firmly to lock the anchor channel in place behind the mounting material. Once the cap is set in place, the straps snap off by hand. The item being fastened affixes to the mounting material by inserting one of the included bolts through the item, into the drilled hole, and through the anchoring channel behind the material and tightening.</p>

<p>Warning: Use one-fourth or less of listed maximum values for safe working loads (as required by local regulations). For more information, see the manufacturer&rsquo;s technical bulletin.</p>

<p>Anchors provide reinforcement to a fastener that would otherwise have insufficient hold in substrates such as concrete, brick, stone, drywall, or other materials for a particular application. The fastener may be included with or integrated into the anchor itself, or it may be sold separately. Anchors provide support through various methods, including expansion from within or behind the substrate or even adhesive compounds.</p>

<h5 id="terrible-flimsy-poor-quality">Terrible, Flimsy, Poor Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stay away from this product, I spent such a hard time last weekend trying to make the anchors to work that I don&rsquo;t know where to start:1) the biggest issue is the thread fit on the Channel, it uses a tight thread instead of a loose thread, which makes it really, really hard to get the bolt through the hole and tight it. This is a nut inside a wall, which means it not necessarily be perfectly aligned so it needs to have some room to joggle the bolt to screw it in. There is basically no room, if the inside nut is not perfectly aligned it won&rsquo;t get in, Iost one nut inside the wall because of this, the bolt was too tight and broke the plastic holding the nut2) The plastic holding the channel (nut) is super-flimsy, it is very easy for it to detach from the nut when tightening the bolt, that happened to the other anchor but I was lucky the bolt hold into the nut and I could tighten it. But that will be the end of that anchor if for some reason I have to remove the bolt3) it just doesn&rsquo;t make ANY sense you have to drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; hole to get a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; bolt into a wall. I use them to install a TV wall mount replacing and old one so I could use two of the previous holes I drilled in the past and installed two similar anchors from other brand and the bolts they used are way thicker (and with a looser fit) so it makes the installation way easier. If you have to drill a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; hole anyway, you should use thicker boltsMy advice is to look for a different brand and if possible one using a thicker bolt, a wider hole in the nut. It will save you time and hopefully avoid the big hassle I went through</p>

<h5 id="marvelous">Marvelous</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a record of hiring the worst contractors alive. I needed to tighten the towel bars in my bathroom and started by purchasing a set of hex wrenches (that he went off with) to do that. Once I had the screw in front of me, tightening it sounded crunchy, so I took it out to see what I was dealing with. Instead of using a molly bolt, he had used a 4&rdquo; toggle bolt that fell between the drywall sheets, and the hole was too big for a molly bolt replacement. The inside of the drywall was broken up due to the contractor over-tightening it. Not inclined to replace that section of drywall, I bought these. They installed like a dream come true and are holding the inside of the wall as well as the towel bar in place. Snug and secure. It, too, will fall between the drywall sheets when the screw is removed some day, but it saved me the trouble of replacing the entire section of drywall behind the original bad job. If I could make any improvement, they would make this product also with an option for longer wings.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-answer">This is the answer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are awesome. I&rsquo;m actually getting better sheer strength from these than a stud. In the attached photo, the standoff on the left is screwed directly into a stud and the one on the right is screwed into the SnapToggle. The entire weight of the snowboard is resting on these two standoffs so there&rsquo;s quite a bit of sheer as the board is trying to push them away from each other. I&rsquo;m seeing less gap between standoff and wall on the SnapToggle side than I am on the stud side.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>plastic parts break too easily. I have a few of these sitting in a junk drawer because when I went to tighten the tabs one side broke. When you can get them in this anchor style is great, this brand just doesn&rsquo;t have pliable plastic like the other ones I have bought for spots where you really have to pull hard to get it snug and lined up center for the bolt to come through..</p>

<p>These are excellent, but be gentile with them until the screw actually is engaged in the metal part of the toggle so it doesn&rsquo;t separate from the temporary plastic guide. I have mine holding up a full rack of heavy pots and pans in the kitchen.BE SURE TO WATCH THE INSTALLATION VIDEO &hellip;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051IBB3G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0051IBB3G/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are the BOMB!! I had a big hole in my wall from a toilet paper holder that kept coming loose. I installed these in a very few minutes replacing the toilet paper holder in the same place right over the holes&hellip;&hellip;like magic, there is a perfectly tight hold!</p>
