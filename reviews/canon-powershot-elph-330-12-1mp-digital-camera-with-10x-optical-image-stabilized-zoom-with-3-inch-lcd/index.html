<p>Give Your Images a Whole New Perspective</p>

<p>10x Optical Zoom with 24mm Wide-Angle lens
The PowerShot ELPH 330 HS features a powerful Genuine Canon 10x Zoom Lens that delivers outstanding optical performance and versatility. Fitting a high-performance lens with such wide zoom range into a camera so thin would normally be considered an impossible feat, but Canon&rsquo;s expert optical engineering met the challenge, developing a lens that achieves outstanding compactness with high zoom power and superb performance. The zoom starts at 24mm wide-angle and extends to 240mm telephoto (35mm equivalent), covering an exceptionally wide range. The telephoto reach gives you the freedom to capture subjects from a considerable distance, while the 24mm wide-angle makes it easy to shoot sweeping landscapes, large groups of people and tall buildings.</p>

<p>Optical Image Stabilizer
Handheld shooting can often lead to camera shake, making photos and videos blurry. Canon&rsquo;s Optical Image Stabilizer is a sophisticated system that uses lens-shift technology to correct for unwanted camera movement. It makes handheld photography more practical, providing excellent image quality in many difficult shooting situations: outdoors at dusk, inside without a flash, and even at the telephoto end of the zoom range without a tripod. For photos, it enables shooting at slower shutter speeds, accommodating more low-light shooting situations than ever before without having to boost ISO sensitivity. With camera shake and vibration reduced, you get a sharper, steadier image. And because it is an optical system, there is none of the image degradation typical with electronic image stabilizers.</p>

<p>Experience the Power
12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor
The PowerShot ELPH 330 HS employs a Canon 12.1 Megapixel CMOS sensor, which delivers state-of-the-art imaging performance and is optimized for use in compact cameras. Utilizing a sophisticated light–capturing design, it provides high sensitivity for improved high ISO capture with reduced noise. It is also a high-speed design, capable of rapidly capturing and moving image data to the processor, enabling faster continuous shooting and faster autofocus.</p>

<p>Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor
The latest-generation Canon DIGIC 5 Image Processor works with the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS&rsquo;s image sensor to bring phenomenal increases in processing speed and power, delivering incredible detail in more situations, without the need for artificial light sources. Improved noise reduction produces clearer images when shooting in low light at high ISO speeds. The faster processing speed results in faster continuous shooting capability while maintaining full image quality. With the power of the DIGIC 5 Image Processor, the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS can achieve higher ISO sensitivity and even perform advanced functions like lens correction, special scene modes and much more.</p>

<p>Canon HS SYSTEM for exceptional low-light performance up to ISO 6400
The PowerShot ELPH 330 HS gives you the power to create images with spectacular depth, detail and emotional resonance. The 12.1 Megapixel High-Sensitivity CMOS sensor works in concert with the DIGIC 5 Image Processor to create the renowned Canon HS SYSTEM. With the Canon HS SYSTEM, you&rsquo;ll experience excellent tracking performance even in low light, and achieve gorgeous still image quality even at high ISO speeds all the way up to ISO 6400; beautiful low-light shots are possible with minimal noise and maximum detail in highlight and shadow areas. The Canon HS SYSTEM lets you use higher shutter speeds to capture clearer images with reduced noise and blur in a variety of situations for incredible photos and even when shooting video.</p>

<p>Get the Complete HD Experience
Capture beautiful 1080p Full HD video in stereo sound with a dedicated movie button; zoom while shooting and play back videos on an HDTV via the HDMI output
Simply touch the dedicated movie button on the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS to start recording video in 1080p Full HD that is breathtakingly vivid and realistic. You&rsquo;re free to use the full range of the zoom in movie mode, and sound is recorded in stereo. HDMI output allows you to view and share your video on an HDTV immediately, simply by connecting the camera to the TV with an optional HDMI cable.</p>

<p>Remember the Day in Crisp HD
New Hybrid Auto utilizes a combination of Smart AUTO and Intelligent IS to create a beautiful and steady 720p HD video clip in Movie Digest mode every time you shoot a still image
New Hybrid Auto on the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS brings enhanced image quality to the popular Movie Digest feature on PowerShot digital cameras. Movie Digest records up to four seconds of video every time you shoot a still image, then automatically joins the clips into a video that captures the essence of special days: vacations, important occasions, any time you&rsquo;re shooting many shots in a day. With Hybrid Auto, this &ldquo;highlight reel&rdquo; is more beautiful than ever. Hybrid Auto automatically recognizes the scene and optimizes camera settings to capture the highest possible image quality. The resulting 720p HD video is properly exposed, crisp and steady.</p>

<p>Faster Focus and High-speed Shooting</p>

<p>High Speed AF greatly improves focus speed and High-Speed Burst allows continuous shooting (6.2 fps) while maintaining superb image quality</p>

<p>The PowerShot ELPH 330 HS is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s latest advancement in AF technology: High Speed AF. The result of several improved technologies, High Speed AF delivers a significantly faster focus speed of 0.16 seconds and a dramatically reduced shooting lag time of 0.19 seconds for a super-responsive shooting experience that lets you capture every great shot as it happens. The technology also powers the camera&rsquo;s High-Speed Burst with continuous shooting at 6.2 frames per second. Moreover, images captured in High-Speed Burst maintain the camera&rsquo;s superb image quality.</p>

<p>Optimal Image Stabilization in Any Situation
Intelligent IS automatically chooses from six different modes to optimize image stabilization for the shooting condition
It&rsquo;s easy to capture clear, steady images with the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS, even in low light without using a tripod. That&rsquo;s because the camera is equipped with Canon&rsquo;s innovative Intelligent IS. The system analyzes camera movement and applies the best shake correction method for the shooting situation – allowing you to focus on framing and capturing your shot. For stills, the system automatically selects among Normal, Panning, Macro (Hybrid) and Tripod IS modes. When shooting video, the system automatically selects among Dynamic, Powered, Macro and Tripod IS modes.</p>

<p>Normal  Corrects for a wide range of camera movement when shooting stills.
Panning Panning motion is detected so that IS does not interfere with desired camera movement.
Macro (Hybrid)  Corrects for shift-type camera shake, which typically occurs in macro (close-up) shooting.
Dynamic Effective for video shooting at wide-angle focal lengths, eliminating the unwanted shaking that typically occurs while walking.
Powered Compensates for hand movement when shooting video at the telephoto end of the zoom range, where camera shake is magnified.
Tripod  When tripod use is detected, the Image Stabilizer is stopped because it is not needed.
A Charge that Lasts as Long as a Memory
New ECO Mode helps reduce power consumption for longer battery life.
The PowerShot ELPH 330 HS takes energy conservation to the next level with ECO Mode, which provides more shots per single charge through LCD monitor and camera power management. ECO Mode can be activated for easy power preservation when an outlet is unavailable or the moment is too exciting to put the camera down. ECO Mode quickly wakes the camera from sleep when a button is pressed. With ECO Mode activated to conserve power, you can even stay connected for longer with the built-in Wi-Fi® feature on the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS. When the fun with family and friends runs late into the night, you can be assured your camera can keep up.</p>

<p>Additional Features
Smart AUTO
Smart AUTO for the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS makes it easier than ever to capture the sharp, bright, colorful images and videos you&rsquo;re looking for. By assessing various factors in both the background and the subject, the system recognizes 58 predefined shooting situations and automatically selects the camera settings that will yield the best possible results. Simply frame the shot you want, and in dozens of common or challenging scenarios the camera takes care of the rest. Hard-to-capture shots such as moving subjects, night scenes, backlit subjects, and landscapes at evening or on a bright, snowy day are instantly and effortlessly captured as &ldquo;keeper&rdquo; shots. Smart AUTO makes the PowerShot ELPH 330 HS ideal for capturing excellent quality still images and video on the go.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have just finished taking my new Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 HS camera through a lengthy shakedown cruise. I have learned a number of things about it and will share my findings as clearly as I can.You should know that I have far more digital cameras than one person should own. My experience with them over the years has given me some degree of confidence in what I say about the Canon ELPH 330HS. This is my second Canon camera. I also own a Canon PowerShot SX230 HS which is similar in several ways.I am an avid amateur travel photographer and my remarks are influenced by using my cameras extensively for that purpose.I hope the following observations will help you make a decision about the Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 HS.Pros:* The camera is quite small and a true pocket dweller.* Mine is silver in color and it looks great.* It takes excellent pictures with the AUTO setting, but there are many options for those who think they can do better manually.* It has an extensive of list of shooting modes for every situation.* It has face recognition along with blink and smile shooting features.* The low light capacity of the camera is outstanding.* 12.1 megapixels put a lot of detail in the pictures.* The 10x optical zoom is plenty and the anti-shake feature keeps them crisp.* The image stabilization feature works very well and it is automatic.* Close-up shots are beautiful.* The WiFi feature is outstanding technology and that makes this camera special.* I use the WiFi in my ELPH 330 HS for wirelessly transferring photos to both iOS devices and PC computers. That is amazing.* The camera stores images on SD memory cards so pictures can be shared with a computer that way too.* Using the WiFi one can also upload photos directly to social networks or email.* I used the free Apple app Camera Window to connect with my iPod 5g and it worked better than the Canon suggestions found in the DVD instruction manual.* Paring with a PC computer is a bit tricky, but it can be done by ordinary mortals.* The display window on the camera is large and bright.* The 330HS movies are excellent and there are a number of shooting options available.* There is even full HD video in stereo sound available.* The fit and finish are very good and that means this is a solid high quality camera.Cons:* Setting up the WiFi feature is not all that easy even though some of it is automatic.* WiFi photo transfer is somewhat slow, but no problem.* The camera controls are not made for large fingers.* I miss the manual shooting mode wheel&ndash;poking around on screen based options is too slow to be useful if scenes, locations and objects change rapidly.* The instruction manual on the provided DVD is confusing for setting up WiFi.* The Hybrid movie feature is strange and seems to have limited purpose.* I have yet to determine what the body of this camera is made of. It seems very light in weight which suggests plastic, but maybe aluminum.* One can get bogged down and confused by the myriad of options available and it is difficult to find the way back out of unwanted settings. There is a way to re-set everything just in case.That is about all of the first impression information I can offer. I plan to carry my new ELPH 330 HS to Europe later in the spring and hope to take advantage of the WiFi features for sending photos back home to friends and relatives while I am traveling abroad.UPDATE:I have just returned from two weeks in Great Britain and almost 700 photos taken with my Canon ELPH 330 HS and I was very satisfied with the how it performed. This little camera did everything I asked of it. Transferring all of those pictures to my iPad and to my Windows 7 laptop via WiFi was a perfect addition to the many other features. I am even more impressed with this camera after putting it to a very rigorous test. I bumped the camera around a lot on our trip and without a case on it. I even dropped it once and it kept on ticking. As a travel camera it is the best of the bunch as far as I am concerned.</p>

<h5 id="canon-powershot-elph-330-hs-camera-review">Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 HS Camera Review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 HS Camera ReviewThe choices available today in digital cameras might seem bewildering. In many ways, they are, for cameras are often classified in random fashion. No one seems to know what a &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; camera is, what a long-zoom camera is, and what affordable might happen to be. There is no clear distinction from where &ldquo;point and shoot&rdquo; ends and &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; or prosumer-marketed cameras begin. It changes annually.We hardly buy cameras based on image quality alone. As I write this, the #1 selling digital camera on Amazon is the Nikon Coolpix L820, a fairly large and heavy 30x unit powered by four AA batteries. On the same list, the #11 spot is held by the same L820 with a red case. While a lot of camera for the money (selling at the same $170 level as this Elph 330), the Nikon L820 wins no &ldquo;best of the best&rdquo; awards, but buyers think quite differently.There are a lot of things to consider, if you want to be satisfied with your camera for the life of your use with it. Although volumes have been written about image quality, that isn&rsquo;t the main reason why folks are dissatisfied with cameras, much less the only reason. Here are a few of the most common concerns, interlaced with Elph 330 relevant comments.BATTERY LIFEDigital cameras with dead batteries don&rsquo;t work well. The current lithium-ion type of rechargeable battery isn&rsquo;t new technology at all. Batteries can be of most any capacity a manufacturer wants them to be, though few relish the prospect of running a digital camera with fork-lift batteries.They are often small, for a battery enclosed inside the frame of a camera partly determines the envelope dimensions and weight of the camera. It is hard to get a light camera if it runs on four AA batteries, which at one time was common. Cameras are not totally redesigned annually, just re-marketed annually. Yet, when more features are added (better image stabilization, larger LCDs, etc.) battery drain goes up and life drops in concert. We don&rsquo;t want larger, bulkier cameras in general, and manufacturers like to build upon existing frames, so the quicker, more powerful zoom motors and bigger LCDs take their toll, as does advanced image stabilization arrays.The Canon ELPH 330 HS (IXUS 255 HS in Europe) takes the NB-4L battery, and is good for about 220 still-image shots. For video, you&rsquo;ll do well to get 45 minutes or so, less in cold weather. As a rule of thumb, lithium-ion cells give 65 - 70% life at 32 degrees F. vs. 70 degrees F. Extra batteries are readily available and inexpensive: I always carry two fully-charged extras, in addition to the one in the camera.ZOOM RANGEYou can&rsquo;t have too much usable zoom, but that of course comes with a price. The ELPH 330 has a 10x zoom (24mm - 240mm), something everyone will appreciate vs. the common 5x or 8x variety shirt-pocket cameras. Canon also has their &ldquo;Zoom Plus&rdquo; 20x mode, a digital zoom along the lines of Sony&rsquo;s Clear Image and Panasonic&rsquo;s Intelligent Zoom. All of these digital zooms do about the same thing. While they aren&rsquo;t as good as true optical zoom, they do produce far better results than older digital zoom attempts did. To say no loss of image quality isn&rsquo;t strictly true, but for 4 x 6 or 5 x 7 prints few could notice the difference.SHOOTING PERFORMANCEWaiting for a camera to autofocus or to save images to file is no fun. Canon&rsquo;s compact cameras have been sluggish in times past, including the SX230 that I eventually quit using in favor of a Panasonic ZS-15. Autofocus time and lag time is significantly reduced in the ELPH 330, about one third faster than their previous 310 and other models. It is a readily noticeable and welcomed improvement. Autofocus does do some searching, particularly when using zoom in low-light.LOW-LIGHTInvariably, when small sensors are overpopulated with super-dinky photo-sites, image quality suffers. How much it suffers is contingent on the camera&rsquo;s software and processor, but it does suffer. Unfortunately, mega-pixels sells cameras, and if it doesn&rsquo;t make dollars it doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Fortunately, Canon has stayed with the 12MP sensor, while others have succumbed to the large file, but lower quality nonsense.Within its range, the ELPH 330 takes far better than average stills. It handily out-shoots several similarly sized pocket cameras at ISO 800. With low noise images to ISO 1600, less than 1.5%, it does as good or better than many cameras at base ISO.VIDEOFew compact cameras are ideally suited to video for reasons of battery life and image stability when not using a tripod. Enclosed batteries in small chassis make for a very poor heat sink as well. This Canon does just average in the video quality department, very dark in low light and just average quality otherwise. It isn&rsquo;t a resolution issue.FOX and Disney (ABC, ESPN) broadcast in 720p HD, the rest mostly use 1080i. The hyped 1080p capabilities of pocket cameras make little sense, including this Canon as the harder to edit 1080p is at 24 fps per second, or film rate. Unless you plan on burning Blu-rays, using anything other than 720p is a waste of file size editing time, rendering time, and upload time with footage captured with a small-sensored still camera. It makes even less sense if the video is viewed on a Smartphone with a 3.5 - 4 inch screen for example.WI-FIThough a recent, loudly touted &ldquo;feature&rdquo; in cameras, it is one of very little value as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Sending pictures to yourself makes little sense, nor does spamming social media direct from a camera. Images of interest that are sent along invariably benefit from a bit of thoughtful review, light cropping, and so forth. The grand benefit of frenetically rushing to send an image of a bowl of oatmeal straight to Facebook under the guise of &ldquo;sharing&rdquo; somehow escapes me. While perhaps theoretically useful for professional engagements where you&rsquo;d like to show images to clients immediately, it serves mostly as yet another way to needlessly drain the battery of a compact camera.LENSJim Fisher, using Imatest to determine the sharpness of the Elph 330 lens, found that it scored 2069 lines, well above the 1800 lines required for a sharp photo, and dramatically better than the Panasonic SZ-7&rsquo;s 1563 lines. Jim Fisher also found the noise levels held under 1.5% at ISO 1600, rising to a still quite respectable 1.9% at ISO 3200. The Nikon P510 bridge camera scored 1,865 lines, while the Canon SX40 HS scored 1,836 lines. The Panasonic FZ-200 scored 1811 lines; the Panasonic ZS-20 scored a weak 1662 lines per picture height.The Elph 330 starts out at F/3.0 at the wide angle end, fairly bright for a compact, but drops off to a small F/6.9 at the 10x end. The Elph 330&rsquo;s lens is demonstrably sharp, better than many more expensive cameras from many brands, including other Canon product. It betters both the premium 5x compact Canon S120 that managed 1897 lines at 24mm / F/1.8 and edges out the latest Canon SX280 that managed 1957 lines. While lens sharpness isn&rsquo;t the exclusive barometer for grading a camera, the Elph 330 is class-leading in this regard, and produces sharper images than several &ldquo;enthusiast&rdquo; level compacts that sell for more than double the price.FLASHThe small flash unit of the Elph 330 is just average, not nearly as effective or as even (some vignetting) as the more substantial flashes found on larger footprint cameras. It is one of the compromises inherent in small, light cameras, and the Elph 330 is no exception. The best thing about the Elph 330&rsquo;s flash, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned, is that don&rsquo;t need to use it as much as some super-compacts make you.CONTROLS / HANDLINGThis is a 5 ounce, very compact camera. With its diminutive form factor, less buttons, wheels, and smaller buttons in general are a consequence of retaining the small envelope dimensions. If you have moderately chubby fingers, you won&rsquo;t like this camera. I don&rsquo;t have chubby fingers, but the flush buttons and lack of a raised control wheel made using this camera in other than just full automatic, &ldquo;hit the button mode&rdquo; a chore.CONCLUSIONThis is a superb pocket camera, that does what a camera should do: take good images, and take them reliably. Its general no flash performance, for this super-compact class of camera, is good, despite its dark F.6.9 lens @ 10x. If you put a high priority on bulk and weight, and can live with the tiny flush button controls, it takes satisfying pictures for this light and small class of camera. If you can tolerate an extra few ounces, you&rsquo;ll be able to get far more out of the 7 oz. - 8 oz. class of pocket camera, though, with easier to use and more appropriately sized controls, along with longer focal lengths.Copyright 2013 by Randy Wakeman and Randy Wakeman Outdoors.</p>

<p>I bought this camera after going through a ton of reviews and watching videos on YouTube. I wanted something portable that I could take to conventions and events with out cables or having to set up a tripod or stabilizer. This camera is a really awesome and dependable model. The photos are crisp and sharp, the video and sound quality are amazing. The front facing mic picks up sounds amazingly well. Files transfer quickly and it charges fast. Got an extra battery and I have only ever needed to swap out after several days use. Its really good for shooting in low light situations. I have not found myself regretting this camera at all. Its really the camera to take on day trips. No lens&rsquo;s to fuss with, no extra cords or power supplies. No time limits. Its really a great product by a great company. If I could name one flaw it would be that its so darn pricey. Its a middle range camera that performs like a higher end model. So price point is moot. I would have a dozen of these if it was practical. Its helped me with on the spot interviews and just shooting a quick vlog. Easy compact, lite. I&rsquo;d be lost with out it</p>
