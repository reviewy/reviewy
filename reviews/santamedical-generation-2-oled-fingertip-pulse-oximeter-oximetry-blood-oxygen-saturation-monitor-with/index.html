<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="very-nice-monitor-for-a-very-good-price">Very nice monitor for a very good price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am an RN at a hospital. I compared the accuracy of this unit with the expensive 02 monitors carried by the Respiratory Therapists. It was spot on! Very nice monitor for a very good price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="accurate-and-good-for-small-children">Accurate and good for small children</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to parse through all the pulse oximeters available on Amazon since so many have sponsored reviews, which is annoying at best and misleading at worst. The reason I chose this pulse ox was that it had a low proportion of negative reviews. We needed a pulse oximeter for our toddler and this serves the purpose really well. When using it for a smaller child you may need to try a couple of fingers to find the best one - for us the middle finger is more reliable than the smaller index finger; I&rsquo;d guess a toddler&rsquo;s thumb might also work. Be sure that their finger is all the way into the pulse ox meter and that the fingertip touches the black rubber ridge close to the hinge.This pulse ox meter gives relatively quick readings, is accurate and has large clear numbers along with different display modes. It does take a little longer to get a reading on a small finger than on a bigger person but that is probably typical for this type of device, and it&rsquo;s at least as fast as the one that our pediatrician uses. We use this for the toddler and (for &ldquo;fun&rdquo;) on her older siblings which is a good calibration check. Big kids and adults tested have always been in the 98-100 range; when the little one has had lower readings her figures have been consistent with observation, our prior experience, and cross-checks at the doctor&rsquo;s office. The power button is easy to operate so we get her to press that herself. It also functions to cycle through different display styles, which is a good way for a little one to pass the time while waiting for the reading.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-advertised">As advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to set up and understand. Product works as advertised and seems to be accurate. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommended">Recommended</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works very well and fast. Reliable and matches this doctors doc device</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value">Good Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems to work fine, we have no way of calibrating it against a top notch measuring system. One oddity is the battery compartment &ndash; normally the negative (flat) end of a battery goes on a coil spring. In this device the coils are both at the same end and one connects to the positive terminal. It fooled us at first.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="brighter-than-a-firefly-at-midnight">Brighter than a firefly at midnight!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The new OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) technology is phenomenal &hellip; like the strip above the keyboard on the new MacBook Pro 15 laptop computer. It is bright, sharp, clear and extremely easy to read in all light conditions. It also costs about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> as much as my earlier top-of-the-line oximeter (which stopped working). The six different selections make it easy to read in any position, and the two high-resolution &ldquo;wave form&rdquo; heartbeat line displays of my heart beat is most interesting, helpful and a great added bonus</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="purchased-in-july-2016-to-have-the-peace-of-mind">Purchased in July 2016 to have the peace of mind &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Purchased in July 2016 to have the peace of mind when our son is sick. He&rsquo;s had issues in the past when he has any sort of respiratory illness. The product seems to have reliable and consistent readings, however we just wish it would retain the orientation of the view between uses. It always resets to the default orientation and changing it is not as quick as it should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-a-very-nice-little-oxygen-saturation-measurement-devise">This is a very nice little oxygen saturation measurement devise</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice little oxygen saturation measurement devise. It uses readily available AAA batteries, shuts itself off in a short time, and gives you a graphical review of your heart beat as well as the beats per minute. I checked the oxygen saturation against the unit the hospitals use and the Santamedical was right on the money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product is great - use it for work doing vitals. Recommend it 👍</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-how-simple-the-display-is-to-see-and-read">Love how simple the display is to see and read</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love how simple the display is to see and read. It measured accurately when tested against two other medical devices.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow">Wow!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product works great! Much better than one that I bought at national pharmacy chain store for twice the cost.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-product-for-less-money">High Quality Product for Less Money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I work in an Emergency Department, and I was looking around for things to put in my personal emergency response bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product">Good Product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice product with some useful features. Reasonable price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works Great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<h5 id="this-product-has-worked-great-for-me-so-far">This product has worked great for me so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product has worked great for me so far. Extremely easy to use and the screen is easy to read.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="faster-response-than-other-pulse-oximeters-on-amazon">Faster response than other pulse oximeters on Amazon.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Responds faster than other pulse oximeters on Amazon to changes in heart rate. This is important for any exercise physiology program where you must maintain a certain heart rate&hellip;</p>
