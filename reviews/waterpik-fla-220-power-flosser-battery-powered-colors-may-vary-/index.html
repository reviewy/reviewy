<h5 id="love-it">LOVE it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I attribute my great dental checkups to this little tool. I hate to floss, I can even use this in the car. I have VERY little plaque build up and VERY healthy gums (@72 yrs old) my husband and I both go to the dentist for cleaning every 6 months, I have little to nothing to clean while he&rsquo;s in the chair for an hour. I use this power flosser, he flosses the old way. So go figure &hellip;</p>

<h5 id="tomato-bloom-pollination-device-also-flosses-teeth">Tomato Bloom Pollination Device Also Flosses Teeth!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am proud to say I don&rsquo;t know anyone who likes to floss, including me, but this inexpensive little tool makes it much less tiresome and almost pleasant. So I floss now, and my dentist and hygienist can actually tell that I am doing so. I always thought this flossing business was overrated with regard to long term effects, but I was wrong. Apparently flossing really does make significant long term differences, not to mention the shorter term advantages of not going around with food in my teeth, like Jaws. Who knew. Go figure. The battery lasts forever, and here&rsquo;s an added bonus: if you are a veggie gardener, this device is THE PERFECT TOOL for pollinating tomato blooms. Warning: if you are married, using your partner&rsquo;s flosser on your tomato plants may lead to marital instability. So buy two or more; one (or two) for your bathroom, and one for the garden. You may be grateful that I have decided not to include a video of me flossing with this thing, but I might submit an instructional video in June or July on how to get your tomato plants to bear fruit with it. Those of you with a sense of humor, stay tuned! Sincerely, Shawn - the perfect-checkup-veggie-grower.</p>

<h5 id="a-vibrating-skinny-toothpick">A vibrating skinny toothpick</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s what this is. I don&rsquo;t know why I thought that this held water like a WaterPik, a small portable one, but it doesn&rsquo;t !Ok, so that idea went out the window. I tried it anyway and it really works wonders. Here&rsquo;s the reason why.I&rsquo;ve got a new, slight space between 2 back teeth, just enough for food particles to get forced down into. When I would floss, the particles were SHOVED down into the gums. This is not good. So out came my old, still working, klunky water pick that I&rsquo;ve had for well over a decade, hated the mess it caused and it was user unfriendly, but it worked great.That&rsquo;s when I went searching for a smaller portable WaterPik. This was not that, BUT I was able to slide the tiny pick UNDER the food particles and it vibrated them out&hellip;.every time! A swish of water, or whatever, (I keep it on me at work, I&rsquo;m a grazer for my 12hr shifts) and the space is food free! works great for my bridge too.If this thing only lasts a month, I&rsquo;ll replace it every month, that&rsquo;s how important and functional it is for me.The little picks don&rsquo;t last too long, I change it daily. A small price to pay for keeping my teeth and healthy gums. This may not work for everyone, those with braces might find it challenging and i expect it would shred the little picks quicker than usual. I also bought the Panasonic portable water pick and I&rsquo;m going to buy another. It works great too!Oh, and this WaterPik also fits in my little cross-body purse I keep on me. It&rsquo;s always with me and no water needed!</p>

<h5 id="great-power-flosser">Great power flosser</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this WaterPik power flosser for my 12 year old son, that&rsquo;s in the process of getting braces. The dentist said to get one and so far this one has worked good. It does floss your teeth very easily, it has a flexible nylon tip that slips easily between teeth and is gentle on gums. This is easier to use and has been clinically proven as effective as manual floss for improving gum heath. This also includes replaceable AA battery and 15 disposable tips. This is something I would recommend to someone that is looking for an affordable waterpik.</p>

<h5 id="fun-to-use-but-effective-i-don-t-know">Fun to use. But effective? I don&rsquo;t know</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmm, I struggle to see what this gadget really provides. Tickling of the gum line? Inability to get the rogue pieces of lettuce out of my teeth? That it&rsquo;s kinda fun to use?♢No, this does not shoot water. Yes, I too thought it did.♢Thin and tapered rubber tip (about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of an inch long) with a small ball on the end.♢Battery included (cool) but you must hold down the power button the whole time (not cool).♢Just enough vibration to feel like you&rsquo;re being tickled, yet not enough to dislodge food particles.♢Small circumference and lightweight so fits into the decorative toothbrush holder I bought for reasons I don&rsquo;t understand since I have an electric toothbrush.♢Shuts off when the tip is depressed too hard. I guess that&rsquo;s the cue that I should take it easier on my gums?♢Replacement tips seem to run about 20 cents a piece on Amazon. I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how frequently these are supposed to be replaced (the package didn&rsquo;t indicate much beyond &ldquo;replace worn tips by removing&hellip;.&rdquo;). I suppose it looks &ldquo;worn&rdquo; after one use, so 20 cents twice a day (hahaha&hellip;as if I actually remember to do it that often). That equals $12 a month in tips, which means after a few months I could just buy a true waterpik.I&rsquo;m no dentist so I can&rsquo;t say whether or not this actually works on a level only a dentist could see, but every dentist I&rsquo;ve had has always said, &ldquo;just use regular floss&rdquo;. Then again, if this device actually gets people doing anything remotely close to flossing, I&rsquo;m sure a dentist would approve.</p>

<p>You have to to try this to appreciate it. Very handy little tool for flossing and very inexpensive.</p>

<h5 id="quick-easy-to-use-and-effective">Quick, Easy to Use, and Effective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a replacement for my last WaterPik Flosser that I&rsquo;d had for far too long, it just wouldn&rsquo;t quit and kept on going. But it was getting a little grungy.This Flosser was Fast and Strong compared to my old flosser. I guess the old one was a little time-worn.My contentedness with this Flosser has been renewed.Plus the most important thing, it&rsquo;s great for my gums and does a super job. Be a little easy at first until your gumstoughen up and get used to this powerful cleaning machine. I think you&rsquo;ll be pleased when next you visit your Dental Hygienist,And so will she be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-does-the-job">It does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It does its job, but the tips bend out of shape and become unusable unless the tip is trimmed by about an 1/8th of an inch. Then each tip will fit between the teeth and last for more than two uses.</p>

<p>I should have paid more attention, because it has &ldquo;WaterPik&rdquo; in the name, I assumed it was maybe a weaker, portable version of the actual water pick I have in the&hellip;</p>
