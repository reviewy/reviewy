<h5 id="very-nice-for-the-beach-surprised-at-how-light-and-how-easy-it-is-to-open-up-and-close-back-in-the-bag">Very nice for the beach. Surprised at how light and how easy it is to open up and close back in the bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I took this out to the beach already. I did not think it really deals with the sand as advertised. I am surprised and excited to say that it works as advertised. I really like the blue color and the nylon is still very comfortable. It is also really sturdy nylon which is made with ripstop so it will be difficult to damage it under normal use. It folds up easily and it is made from a light weight material so it is not a heavy item to carry in your beach bag.It is also very light. And the bag it comes with which is part of the blanket makes it easy to put in it again and compress it down to a small size. It is also pretty large and can easily fit 2 or 3 people on it. The extra pockets are a nice feature. Also the corners have little pockets on them you can add sand to to help weigh it down to keep in blowing around. No tent pegs needed. I really like this blanket and would recommend it to anyone for the park or the beach!If you have found my product review to be helpful, please hit the helpful button.

<h5 id="we-love-using-it-now">We love using it now&mdash;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a neat idea to own with kids around, From park, backyard and especially on the beach. I got this beach blanket and decided to buy it as my family and I are always doing outdoor fun activities especially this summer and this will be really useful around the pool area.This blanket is huge and definitely big enough to sit 6 adults or lots of goofy kids. The material is very lightweight but it feels strong. It is bright powder blue and gray. It comes in a pouch which keeps it tidy and easy to carry, also good for storage.The blanket has pockets in the corners and comes so you can anchor the mat down with heavy stuff.This blanket is exactly what we wanted. It will keep us comfy when sitting on the grassland and we can use it in our tent as a floor liner too. Not a bad summer accessories to own during busy summer time.</p>

<h5 id="very-large-perfect-to-keep-in-the-trunk-just-ball-it-up-and-stuff-it-into-the-built-in-bag-video-review">Very large, perfect to keep in the trunk. Just ball it up and stuff it into the built in bag (video review)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Perfect blanket to keep full-time in the trunk of my car. Perfect for spontaneous adventures. Great for the beach, but I like it best for using on grass. This is the type of material that will stay dry on damp grass. For music festivals, outdoor concerts, or picnics, this is a great first layer on the grass. A regular blanket will start feeling clamy after a few minutes if the grass has any moisture in it. This blanket has pockets on the corners that you can put sand in to weight it down. The material is a nylon, similar to a tent material, but softer, it almost seems to have a little elastic in it. Best thing is the built in bag. I know it seems simple, but this isnt something that requires meticulous folding like you’re putting away a map… just ball it up and stuff it in and it will fit.</p>

<h5 id="truly-the-only-blanket-you-will-need-to-use-for-outdoors-and-beach">Truly the only blanket you will need to use for outdoors and beach</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used it one weekend at the beach and it did its job very well. Great size for family and friends at beach and is also perfect blanket for all of the family&rsquo;s outdoor activities!Pros:• Compact and lightweight. Less than a pound and package one 7 inch X3 inches.• Foldable to a very small package. This is huge when packing to beach• Covers a large area easily enough for five or six adults to lay out.• Seems pretty durable and nice material,• Corner pocks are great weighing it down with sand or other items.The metal pegs help us anchor ir in grass easily also.• The material dries ultra quick and the sand slides right off of it.Truly the only blanket you will need to use in your future.</p>

<h5 id="big-light-portable">Big, Light, portable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This blanket was one of the biggest one that I could find for our family picnic. It is super light and can be folded/wrapped in the small bag that it has. It&rsquo;s super easy to store &amp; clean it. The material is thin (that is why the whole thing can be fit in such small bag) and kin of shiny. It&rsquo;s best be used on grass and sand as it&rsquo;s not giving you any cushion. It&rsquo;s also durable so it doesn&rsquo;t get ripped easily. It is not waterproof but it&rsquo;s more of a water repellent type of material. It is also dries super fast. As for the sand it is super easy to get the sand off of it just by shaking it as sands don&rsquo;t stick to it unless they are wet in that case you need to wait for it to get dried which is very quick then you can shake it off. As for the size we were in a group of 4 and we had plenty of room around us and in the middle of it so I&rsquo;d say you can fit pretty much up to 6 people comfortably.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-blanket">Awesome blanket</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice blanket that had multiple uses. This can be used at the beach, make shift canopy tent, picnics or for protection from rain as a make shift poncho.There are a total of 6 pockets, including the one the blanket stores into.There were no stakes shipped wth this blanket so if you are at the beach, the idea is to fill each pocket with sand or place something on each corner to keep it held down.The material is awesome and the stitching was flawless. I went over this blanket quite a few times and didn&rsquo;t see a single issue.It&rsquo;s lightweight, easy to pack and taking it out and putting it back in is a breeze.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice-blanket-bigger-than-most">Very nice blanket - bigger than most</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Review of Sand Proof Compact Large Quick Drying Lightweight Durable Parachute Nylon Outdoor Beach Blanket Picnic Blanket Sand Resistant Oversized 7&rsquo; x 9.5&rsquo;The outdoor blanket is just what we needed for camping. It seems like we always need to spread a blanket on the ground for something. For the kids to play on. To have a picnic. Sometimes just to sit our stuff on so it doesn’t get dirty. We’ve got a blanket, but not at all as big as this one. This one is seven feet by nine and a half feet so it has plenty of room for us and the grandkids.The bag holder is sewn on – very helpful.This is a very well made blanket. It’s both lightweight and strong. It compresses to a good small size and is easy to carry if necessary. The holder has a compression strap that can be used for backpacking.There are pockets on the corner to fill with sand if necessary.This is a fine addition to our camping supplies.</p>
