<h5 id="the-flexible-arm-is-great">The Flexible arm is GREAT!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a cell phone holder that had a flexible neck and was surprised how hard it was to find one! This one looked big in some of the pictures, but when I got it, it was a good length. If anything, for the way I am using, I would like it to be a little longer. I did not install mine on the window, but on the center console so it sticks up in front of my radio. Luckily there is part of my center console that is totally smooth for the suction cup to attach to.The flexible arm is great - I can easily move my phone out the way a bit just by grabbing it and moving it over - it just stays there! It is also easy to spin the phone from tall to wide or wide to tall. The grip system that holds the phone is very secure too, and what I like most about it is that I can get the phone out with one hand. Putting it in required two, one to hold the top and bottom.The suction cup has worked just fine so far.I have had the product for about a month now, and use it with a Galaxy S7. The two corner grips do not get in the way of any the side buttons or screen touch points.Overall - great choice, the flexible arm is the best!</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a phone holder for my car that didn&rsquo;t have that glue sticky that some do. I got this one because it was a suction cup. It works perfectly with the Galaxy 7 edge and an Iphone 6 Plus in an Otter case. It doesn&rsquo;t fall down with the phones in it and I love how you can move the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; part to rotate it. Glad I bought it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I could see how this has the potential to be a good product BUT i am forced to return.TO KEEP THIS SHORT AND SIMPLEIPHONE USERS (as long as you don&rsquo;t have the big bulky plus version like me you can get this case)It could not sustain the weight of the iPhone 6 plus.UPDATE 03/04/17The day I wrote this review about the product the company offered to fully refund me or work with me to try and send me a new product.This is AMAZING customer service.I highly recommend you try the product your experience will be perfect and if there is ever any issue at all you know you&rsquo;ll have this company reach out to make sure the product is to your liking. So happy with everything they have helped me with. Very smooth and at ease with NO frustration at all. I am highly pleased.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-the-practical-gift-giver">Perfect for the Practical Gift Giver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The best product in this category! I&rsquo;ve owned this for over one month (and driven more than 3,000 miles with it) and it does an excellent job. It is easily adjustable to meet the driver&rsquo;s or passenger&rsquo;s needs, stays secure and doesn&rsquo;t vibrate. Mounts easily to any flat, non-textured, surface and stays put. The arm is the perfect length to allow adjustment without being in the way and the adjustable holder for the phone rotates to allow different viewing angles to adapt it to your mounting location. I chose to mount mine in a cup holder (I&rsquo;ve got plenty in my vehicle) which also allowed close access to my charging cable. I found it so useful, I gave one as a gift to a friend. He mounted his underneath his radio console. He found it to be the most practical gift he received over the entire holiday season.</p>

<h5 id="high-quality-phone-holder-for-your-car-truck">High quality phone holder for your car/truck</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent car phone holder. The suction cup is very sticky for a good grip and the articulated arm is plenty long enough to put any where you want on your windshield. The holder itself has a strong grip on my iPhone 6. I would recommend this to anyone. Shipping was fast.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="unique-and-secure-mounting-system">Unique and secure mounting system</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is great! The phone clamping device is unique, extending from corner to corner of the phone, gripping it tightly and allowing any size device to fit. I use it with the iPhone 7 and the fit is great. The iPhone 6 fits great too. I bought a second one for my motorcycle because I was so pleased with the positive clamping system.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised">Works as advertised!</h5>

<p>it&rsquo;s pretty ok, except that it doesn&rsquo;t swivel at the base. That extra feature would&rsquo;ve made it great. But other than that it&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-for-a-reasonable-price">Great product for a reasonable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfect on my iPhone 7. Easy to clip on and remove the phone from the clip. Doesn&rsquo;t bounce around too much.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-i-dea-to-order-this-product">A good i dea to order this product</h5>

<p>Great product, easy to stick on the dashboard, and it&rsquo;s a high quality product. I advise you if you want something work for years, choose this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product arrived on time, and works as described. Very easy to install and use, and pretty robust mechanically.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stays-put">Stays put</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very adjustable, sticks well, stays in position. Bulky maybe, but the thing that attached to the vent did not allow for enough motion, and the phone would make the holder droop.</p>
