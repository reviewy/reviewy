<h5 id="cat-was-very-impressed">Cat was very impressed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was so impressed with my purchase. The projector is great against a white wall. The projector is not a 100 lumen its 1000 lumen which is great for dark rooms. not only was I impressed but my cat was amazed. He could not look away from the screen. He thought it was so life like he started to attack the screen. I think at one point he tried to jump into the movie. My cat gives this two paws up!!!</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-pretty-decent-projector-for-the-money">This is a pretty decent projector for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a pretty decent projector for the money. They keystone adjustment doesn&rsquo;t work very well, and is not worth using at all -If you adjust it, you&rsquo;ll only be able to bring either the top or bottom of the screen into focus. Solution: deal with it being slightly out of square -or trapezoidalI&rsquo;ve attached a couple photo&rsquo;s so you can see, the actual picture quality is pretty nice once the room is dark enough.For reference:The flat screen TV to the right of the photo is a 50&rdquo; (looks tiny compared to the projected image)I am projecting onto a random bed sheet.NOTES: The projector will default to 1280x720 (which is NOT it&rsquo;s native resolution). Manually change resolution to 1280x800 in settings (if using a computer) allows a better image. In my photos, however, I am using a UGOOS UG007B mini android PC with a custom 1080 kernel. The projector easily scaled this to it&rsquo;s native resolution, and you can see for yourself in the photo&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s pretty pleasing to the eyes.I hope this review is helpful.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-projector">Perfect Projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought the FastFox HD Projector to use this Halloween with our AtomFX movie. It worked great, looked so realistic .. better than GREAT. We had over 600 kids come by and they were all scared by the projection .. and parents stopped and watched &hellip; so many people wanted to know how we were able to do it.Awesome! We will be using it again at Christmas with another AtomFX movie. Can&rsquo;t wait!We are also thinking about doing a movie night outside with the screen on our garage, and invite the neighbors over for a movie night. What fun!</p>

<h5 id="preformed-to-expectations">Preformed to expectations.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: Quick to turn on, bright projection, small size.Cons: No vertical leg, using the menu from the unit is un-intuitive.Unit is intended to provide a holographic experience for our Halloween Walkway. Initial testing of the unit straight out of the box were promising and like other reviews have stated the brightness of the picture means you do not have to turn off the room lighting to see the picture. Was a little confused with the four screws that came with the unit since they look too small to use for vertical mounting but I&rsquo;ve not taken off the rubber feet from the bottom of the unit to verify that that is what they are used for that purpose.My only other gripe with the unit is there is a small screw hole on the bottom beside the air filter where a vertical adjustment could be but no leg with the unit to do this with. So some experimentation with household objects will be required to get the picture where you need it if you need the unit facing slightly up or down.</p>

<h5 id="good-quality">good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It was nearly 100 dollars when i bought it, compare to other projector, it has a elegant design and higher price for its WIFI system. I have only used this for viewing home movies so far but was very good exceeded my expectations. The quality of the images were clean, sharp and colorful at this price. It&rsquo;s not a Full HD projector but you can also run the 1080P video. I&rsquo;m glad I bought this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-for-the-price">Amazing for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I almost didn&rsquo;t buy this because of a handful of negative reviews, but wow! I&rsquo;m glad I did. For screening movies big at home it cannot be beat for the price. You do have to physically place it to get the zoom you want but it has a keystoning dial and a decent height adjustment foot. Really happy with this. Note: it&rsquo;s being used with a nice screen that I got for free. Curious to try it out on a sheet in the backyard. Definitely works well in filtered daylight, but even better (of course) with less light&hellip;although it&rsquo;s no slouch with respect to light bleed&hellip;picture holds up well.</p>

<h5 id="good-buy-for-the-price">Good buy for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good buy for the price! My 55 &ldquo; Samsung plasma died, so I looked at several projectors and decided LED projector would be best vice DLP based on longevity of the LED (20k hrs) projector vice most DLP projectors (5 - 6 k hrs). The projector is sharp and yes per other reviewers and also as advertised, it does best in dark or semi dark rooms. Also, the only bad thing is a get a pop noise almost like an electrical popping sound if I plug in my Smart stick into the HDMI port (either port). Not sure why that happens, other equipment such as a DVD BlueRay player is fine. Other than that, great projector for the price. Watching NFL live games are great!!</p>
