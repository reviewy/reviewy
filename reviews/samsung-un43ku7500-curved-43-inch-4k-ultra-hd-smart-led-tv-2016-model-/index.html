<h5 id="the-remote-is-fantastic-it-simply-knows-what-is-connected-to-the">The remote is fantastic, it simply knows what is connected to the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had this TV for a week, and its stunning. I&rsquo;ve found myself staring at the screen when streaming 4k content from YouTube. The remote is fantastic, it simply knows what is connected to the TV, and controls it&hellip;all of it. I can&rsquo;t speak to the sound, because I run my audio through a 5.1 channel system. The apps work really well (Netflix, HBO Now, YouTube, Amazon Video, etc). Its a set worth hanging on a wall where all can see it. Simply beautiful picture for the average viewer. If you&rsquo;re a TV snob, I can&rsquo;t help you. For the other 99% of us, you&rsquo;ll love it.</p>

<h5 id="wowza-in-a-box">WOWZA IN A BOX!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WOW!!!!!!!!!! Ya know when you go to Best Buy or Costco as walk down the row of super tv&rsquo;s, culminating in &ldquo;the one&rdquo; that costs as much as a Hyundai?? The ONE is in my living room! I popped on Netflix&rsquo;s Ultra 4K &ldquo;Moving Arts: Forests&rdquo; via my Dish Network and broaband Wifi which is basically music and amazing forest scenes free content like their &ldquo;fireplace&rdquo;. Holy Cow!!!!! It&rsquo;s just breath-taking, beyond seeing it in person.PICTURE: see above, best I&rsquo;ve ever seen in years of ogling the most expensive ones in stores. Turn off DIGITAL CLEAR VIEW! It causes horrific stuttering in the picture, as mentioned in another review. I set the picture type to &ldquo;Natural&rdquo; for now given my 4k content. I upped contrast and sharpness from default 45 to 55 both. WOWZA!!! A lot of arguments out there about the curve as a feature. It&rsquo;s a matter of opinion it seems. For the 65&rdquo; I really do feel more &lsquo;immersed&rsquo; I can tell you! I don&rsquo;t know if a smaller screen size would compliment the curve as much. I feel sucked into this thing!SOUND: I bought a Samsung soundbar with the tv&hellip; but I keep putting off setting it up. Sound from tv is surprisingly clear, great range including bass and loud!REMOTE: Tv paired with my 4k Hopper 3 from Dish but only manually. The auto pairing failed. However, when I selected sat/cable, it then identified Dish Network Philadelphia. The remote is shocking. It&rsquo;s a tiny thing with none of the normal buttons except volume and kind of a mouse. I was skeptical to say the least. It was just a few minutes to realize what they did with this remote. When it paired with my dish it automatically synced the tv and dish into one. There is actually a consolidated menu (as an overlay on the bottom of the screen) that combines the dish and tv and netflix and Amazon controls into one AWESOME interface that does not block your current content. After an hour with it I have to say I&rsquo;ve experienced the future of tv remotes and I&rsquo;m loving it! You just have to read this and keep an open mind when you first play with it since it is a big (and wonderful) change!SETUP: 8 screws with a Phillips to secure to stand, 3 minutes with my drill/screw-head and a heft 75lb lift and I was done with the physical side. 2 people recommended for the lift as the 65&rdquo; I got and the curve make for an awkward hold. Other than the above mentioned pairing with the new hopper 3 from dish (which did work with an extra 60 seconds effort) setup is a dream. Selecting letters for ids and passwords is super fast and easy with this little remote and the interface and crisp response time.AESTHETICS: She&rsquo;s a beut!!! The stand&rsquo;s v-shape with the wide part facing towards you makes for the ability to push it all the way back on the stand/table you set it on and easy to turn it quite a bit either left or right if you want to. The normal little feet on both ends you see on almost all tv&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t allow this.BOTTOME LINE: She&rsquo;ll have to blow up for me to be anything else but pleased way beyond expectations.<strong>UPDATE 10/4/16</strong>After breaking it in for a few months I still love this TV but I&rsquo;m extremely frustrated with finding so little 4k content. I switched to Dish from Xfinity right when I got this tv and Dish&rsquo;s &ldquo;HD&rdquo; sucks even with the 4k Hopper 3. The only time I see UHD content is from Netflix and it&rsquo;s pretty rare. Nice problem to have and complain though I guess! Also, don&rsquo;t bother with a sound system. I never use mine with this TV&rsquo;s sound being more than sufficient. Deep, rich and loud sound.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-tv-and-great-for-gaming">Beautiful TV and Great for Gaming!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this TV for 4K gaming with PS4. Note that only 1 HDMI slot out of the 3 support HDR. Beautiful picture and perfect size for the bedroom.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="done-with-samsung">Done with Samsung.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Beautiful TV, but does not perform as advertised. And Samsung could not care less.First bought this through Amazon, which provided fantastic customer and technical support throughout&ndash;in stark contrast to Samsung. Wanted to utilize the digital audio (optical) output to a new LG stereo, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Returned the LG and purchased a new Onkyo instead, but digital output from the Samsung still didn&rsquo;t work. Amazon tech support decided that the TV must be defective, so I returned it for a full refund. but since a exchange/replacement was no longer available, Amazon arranged for me to buy it directly from Samsung, online. Amazon even made up the difference in the higher purchase price!And still the digital audio output doesn&rsquo;t work. The remote control is quirky, and voice recognition feature is a joke. When I attempted to register the unit with Samsung online in the hope of obtaining better tech support, that was a massive failure, too. And then, after indicating in the subsequent user survey that I could not complete registration online as intended, I immediately received two very profane and insulting emails to my private email account from a fake email address ridiculing my user feedback&ndash;quite creepy, if not outright scary!The return period having long expired and feeling quite beaten down, we have since installed a Roku Ultra in order to enjoy digital audio and a remote with full streaming capabilities and voice control, bypassing all of the Samsung&rsquo;s useless internal &ldquo;smart&rdquo; features completely and remote. (And yes, we first attempted all Samsung firmware updates and troubleshooting without success.)I will not buy another Samsung product until this mega corporation does some serious soul-searching&hellip;assuming it has one. Spending money on defective products and then being abused when seeking customer support is no way to cultivate customer loyalty. Unacceptable.</p>

<h5 id="this-unit-is-awesome-definitely-recommend">This unit is awesome! Definitely recommend.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The unit arrived in about 34hr from time of order, purchased from Amazon.com LLC as seller. It was boxed well, foam/cardboard support for the curved screen, ensuring it stays in place.First thoughts after unboxing: This unit is the perfect size! Curve looks really nice, and adds a minor depth to images. Awesome that it has AV support still! My old Wii will see use again. The stand is sleek and very stable. Image is crisp and very clear. Setup was a breeze, and my Samsung galaxy tab A connection happened in like 20 seconds before I even knew what happened, internet was going less than 30seconds later after entering passphrase. The remote is sleek and simple, with built in mic feature. Built in Apps are working and browsing smoothly.Overall: this unit it a top quality, mid grade 4k display. It&rsquo;s not the display that looks like your staring into another dimension, like OLED&rsquo;s, but at under $640 shipped to my door it&rsquo;s a far better value. Used as a desktop it&rsquo;s really clear at 4k, games struggle to maintain 120hz at max settings on a liquid cooled 980ti SSC. I set back to 60hz to keep things running smoother.</p>
