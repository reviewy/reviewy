<p>style:DP-008EX
TASCAM has been revolutionizing Portastudio since they invented them. For decades, TASCAM&rsquo;s Portastudio have remained the ideal scratch pads and easy-to-use home recording devices. Utilized by seminal artists and home for legendary albums throughout the years, TASCAM has stayed true to manufacturing rugged, compact, feature-rich song-writing and demo tools. TASCAM is introducing the DP-008EX 8-channel Pocketstudio with built-in input and master effects. Each channel is conveniently loaded with volume, pan, reverb-send knobs, auto-punch in/out, 2 XLR Mic inputs with +48V phantom power and built-in high-quality stereo condenser mics making the DP-008EX an ideal take-anywhere solid-state recorder.</p>

<h5 id="i-like-that-it-has-a-small-size">I like that it has a small size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got my TASCAM DP-006 in the mail today. I like that it has a small size, and the condenser mics are awesome. If you have ever used a multitrack this unit is easy to use and simplistic.The only con I have, that isn&rsquo;t a deal breaker. is the description says &ldquo;Two TRS <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; mic/line inputs&rdquo; when they are actually TR inputs. I plugged both lines into a stereo output with a TRS adapter and it just won&rsquo;t work that way. I had wondered about that because the TASCAM website shows them as TR jacks in the specs. So, if you want to map a stereo input source from a balanced line, you will need a splitter and take the left to A and the right to B or however. But I already had expected that. If you need a balanced input you need the DP-008&hellip;.</p>

<h5 id="great-multi-tracking-recorder-great-price">Great multi tracking recorder, great price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great piece of equipment for a very reasonable price. If you&rsquo;re looking to do simple multi track recording, I would highly recommend this. Great quality recordings. I love the simplicity of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-great-for-my-purposes">It works great for my purposes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I would have given this unit 5 stars but it is not as user friendly as I had hoped. I am, however, very satisfied with the quality of the sound and its portability. I don&rsquo;t know how long the batteries last because I bought a power adapter for it and use that as a matter of preference. The power adapter was very cheap anyway and should save money over using batteries.I have not done anything elaborate with it. I basically just record a track and export it as a WAV file and then use it on my computer in Cakewalk Home Studio. It works great for my purposes, the sound quality is good and the portability is excellent. Real easy to carry around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-what-it-is-supposed-to-very-well">Does what it is supposed to very well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lots of folks knock this for not being more than it is.But if you take it for what it is, you&rsquo;ll be very happy.This is a sketch pad. Sure, you can do a lot more than that with it, but it&rsquo;s not a DAW. I&rsquo;ve been using mine for about two years now, it&rsquo;s been invaluable when I need to get a original pieces sketched into something more than a basic one-take recording for other band members to hear the idea. In a couple hours I can hash out ideas, lay down tracks, mix it down and bounce it to a .wave, then convert that to an .mp3. It is great for throwing down ideas, capturing them for the moment, popping them over to a phone for further listening in the car for refining the idea, etc.. If you get back to them, great. If not, you&rsquo;ve at least saved the idea and it&rsquo;s not gone forever.Can&rsquo;t beat it for what it is IMO.</p>

<h5 id="something-i-used-quite-often-on-my-old-tascam-tape-recorders-everything-else-is-very-cool-i-love-the-internal-metronome">(something I used quite often on my old Tascam tape recorders) everything else is very cool. I love the internal metronome</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although I can&rsquo;t seem to find any way to do pitch adjustment, (something I used quite often on my old Tascam tape recorders) everything else is very cool. I love the internal metronome, we used to have to give up one track for that alone. Sound quality is awesome and that&rsquo;s without even using any of my pro mics yet. (just internal ones) All in all for the price this can&rsquo;t be beat. I highly recommend spending another $25 and getting the hardshell case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-artist-s-scratchpad-i-ve-seen">Best artist&rsquo;s &ldquo;scratchpad&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve seen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THis is an incredible audio &ldquo;notebook&rdquo;. If you love to write music and are often spontaneous in your creation, a device like this is a no-brainer. I still use my full computer DAW, but that can be clumsy to start up and get prepped to record. By the time it&rsquo;s ready, you&rsquo;ve lost the moment. I leave this thing conencted to my electric piano all the time. Takes seconds to power up and create a new audio folder. I&rsquo;m recording within 15 seconds.Audio quality is fantastic for the class of device. I&rsquo;ve recorded line-level keyboard, a phantom-powered condenser mic, and direct attached bass guitar. All sound fantastic. This device is NOT a replacement for studio recording. You can get some decent field recording out of it, but it is ultimately only a 2-channel recorder so if you want to use it for recording a large performance, you would need to pull a stereo feed from a bigger mixer.I&rsquo;m running a 16 GB card in mine which gives me hundreds of hours of recordable time. The export process can be a bit tedious so if you record a LOT of material, it can take some time to get it out of the device as it&rsquo;s in a proprietary format until you export to a standard WAV format. But still, as a &ldquo;scratchpad&rdquo; it&rsquo;s a great tool.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-use">Easy to use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to use. The portability is great. Interface allows for basic track editing with ease. The EQs work better than you&rsquo;d think. The reverb ain&rsquo;t half bad either. The phantom power is nice. Downloading the data to computer for DAW work later is simple as can be.I don&rsquo;t just use it as a sketch pad for ideas, but as my go-to recorder for guitars, electric and acoustic. This machine has a nice little secondary use as well. It&rsquo;s a really nice simple, portable two channel mixer. Works well for messing around with a drum machine and synthesizer, or an ipod or sampler and a digital piano.I do not recommend the AC adapter, as that ties the 8-track down to one spot and makes it less likely you&rsquo;ll use it as an on-the-go recording buddy. The battery life may be limited to around 3 hours, but you can grab an 8 pack of 2700-2900 rechargeable AAs for $15 and then you&rsquo;re pretty much set for life.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-mixer-bad-power">Good Mixer, Bad Power</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far I love this unit, but it wasn&rsquo;t apparent that it didn&rsquo;t come with a power supply. It came with 4 AA batteries. They work and they show me how cool the mixer recorder is, but they&rsquo;re almost dead and they highlight how disposable our society is. I would have paid more up front if I realized the power supply would cost me another $10.99. Just charge properly and provide quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice unit, fairly simple to grasp. It can only hold up to a 32g as card fyi. I tried installing a 64 but would not except.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="to-complicated">To complicated</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To complicated, Don&rsquo;t waste your time.</p>

<h5 id="overall-great-sound-quality-and-portability-for-the-artist-on-the-go">Overall great sound Quality and portability for the artist on the go</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having this unit for several years, I have come to appreciate the versatility, portability, and general ability of the Tascam DP-008EX.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-multi-track-recorder">Nice multi track recorder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good multi track recorder for recording musical sketches&ndash; audio files can be exported into a DAW. Easy to set up and simple to use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-for-the-short-time-i-had-it-worked-great">but for the short time I had it worked great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Item was exactly as described and shipped very quickly. I ended up returning it as I didn’t need it, but for the short time I had it worked great.</p>

<p>awesome tool for sound scratchpad</p>

<p>I bought this for my dad who was a musician. He wanted one of these for a long time. He told me it was a little complicated without reading instructions though</p>
