<h5 id="great-accessory-kit-for-any-action-camera">Great accessory kit for any action camera.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> This is a really nice accessory kit that is compatible with pretty much any kind of action camera. I got my first action camera about 2 weeks ago and have since been playing with it to see what crazy things I can do while taking pictures with it. My hubby also has an action camera, but his came with a full accessory kit. But does the man share with his beloved honey? No, he does not! (Insert epic grumpy wife face and eye-roll here) Well now I have my own accessory kit, which is admittedly better than his, but because I&rsquo;m a nice person and a good wife I&rsquo;ll share. ;)The kit comes with the following:-1 selfie stick-1 Velcro band and mount-1 flexible tripod-1 clip mount-1 suction cup mount-1 chest harness mount-4 mounts with 10 double sided sticky pads-1 float mount- HUGE bag of connectable pieces so you can make a custom mount. My hubby used his to make a mount for his motorcycle helmet.-1 head mount with soft elastic strapsIn other words, pretty much anything you could ever want to do with your camera, you have the tools for it in this kit.I was lucky enough to receive this kit in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion. Honestly, It&rsquo;s an awesome kit! I&rsquo;m super happy with it and I can hardly wait to put all on it to use. :)</p>

<h5 id="amazing-customer-service">Amazing Customer Service!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The items all arrived quickly in a single box. All the items looked to be accurate to the description, but once I started using the items I noticed many of the parts do not fit well with each other or my GoPro. The connector pieces in many instances were too loose or too tight to fit together. The too tight pieces required so much effort to combine that I actually had some pieces crack, others didn&rsquo;t fit at all. The too loose pieces could not be tightened enough to hold the GoPro in a set position.On the other hand, the chest mount, bike mount, wrist, head and float mount all worked really well.The weirdest part is some of the screws aren&rsquo;t actually long enough to even engage the other end for tightening. Those pieces are just useless.UPDATE 4/30/16The seller reached out to me after seeing the review above. He was concerned that some of my items were not up to par! Just hearing from the seller was impressive, but the best part is the seller replaced the bad parts! You can always spend more money for so called better stuff, but you just can&rsquo;t buy great service like this. I&rsquo;m very impressed!!!</p>

<h5 id="a-very-complete-kit">A very complete kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Like this kit very much. As i do not need a case , i choose this. Quality is out of my expectation with this price.I rate 4.<sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub></p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easiest-5-stars-i-ve-ever-given">Easiest 5 stars I&rsquo;ve ever given</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have to give this 5 stars. When I first saw the price and saw some of the reviews I was very skeptical. Less than $15 for all that stuff?! I was convinced that it was cheap and probably didn&rsquo;t fit right. But one review stuck out where the buyer said that they didn&rsquo;t fit and the company immediately addressed his concern and replaced everything which resulted in him giving them a higher review. So I took a chance thinking well if even one of the brackets I want works I&rsquo;ll make my money since they go for $20.00-$25.00 on average here in Hawaii.To my surprise everything works as it should and the quality is pretty solid. At least one of the bolts doesn&rsquo;t have the Philips screw end on the inside which can be bad if it ever comes unglued from the black knob so I will never be using that one. I think it&rsquo;s the one that came with the yellow hard plastic floatation device. That&rsquo;s the only piece that looks and feels cheep. In fact it seems smaller than I thought it would be but that may be a good or bad depending on buyer&rsquo;s needs. To be honest I feel like they gave me extra stuff. It&rsquo;s A LOT. Easily over $150 worth of stuff here. Tested all the brackets on my Go Pro Hero3+ Black Edition and everything fit. One was slightly loose (gator clip) so that might cause some movement when clipped to something and it&rsquo;s jarred hard enough. Bottom line: this is the easiest 5 star rating I&rsquo;ve ever given. Buy it ASAP before they raise the price of run out.</p>

<h5 id="incredible-amount-of-items-for-the-money-seems-to-be-as-good-as-gopro-brand-accessories">Incredible amount of items for the money! Seems to be as good as gopro brand accessories.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>VERY nice kit for the money! These items are $20-30++ for EACH item if you buy the gopro brand! I handled the entire kit and it seems as well built as the original gopro mounts that came with my camera. Seems like good quality stuff and it&rsquo;s a TON of stuff for $20! Can&rsquo;t wait to use these mounts for different things. The main items I bought this kit for were the handlebar mount for my motorcycle, the suction cup for my rock crawler jeep and floating handle for our cruise in March. The wife and I plan on doing some of the snorkeling trips and I can&rsquo;t wait to film it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-can-i-say-it-has-just-about-every">What can I say, it has just about every &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What can I say, it has just about every attachment for a GoPro or any other action camera with the same attachment as the GoPro that you could possibly want. All parts are quality made and most are indistinguishable from the original GoPro attachments. I have not personally tried all of them but I have used most of them on various occasions including the floating handle, the head strap, the chest strap, handlebar clamp, the table clamp, the windshield holder,selfie stick and most of the various screws, angle bracket, and extenders. I have not had a problem with any of these. At such a low price you saving a bundle. So get out there and shoot some video.</p>

<h5 id="the-perfect-action-or-family-fun-kit">The perfect action or family fun kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This kit has more than I expected. It arrived in Australia not too long after I ordered it. When you unpack everything it feels like you have a million spare parts and screws - more than you&rsquo;ll ever need! I bought it mostly for the chest harness and bike mount - both of which I&rsquo;ve used already. Thank you for all of the pictures in the listing, it makes it easier to comprehend what you&rsquo;re getting. It&rsquo;s also nice to see how you can use the more obscure mounts, like the rotating clip and adhesive strips.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-cool-for-the-money">Pretty cool for the money..</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for me 16 yr old daughter and her camera&rsquo;s&hellip; let&rsquo;s say she as put it ALL to the test with her little brother, the pool, snowboarding, outside, tricks&hellip;. it&rsquo;s worth the money I paid. Thanks !</p>
