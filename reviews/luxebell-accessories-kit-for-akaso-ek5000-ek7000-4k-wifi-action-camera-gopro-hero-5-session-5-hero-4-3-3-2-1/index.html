<h5 id="great-starter-kit-for-my-gp-hero-4-session">Great starter kit for my GP Hero 4 Session.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This set proved very useful on our last trip, especially the flotie and monopod during snorkeling, and the head strap when kayaking. I haven&rsquo;t used the bike handle clamp and suction cup. The screws got rusty easily, but I think it&rsquo;s because I forgot to rinse them after using in seawater. So DO rinse them after saltwater use. Read the list of actual contents in the details section of the page. Mine did not come with the white plastic case attached to the headstrap in the picture. They explained that that was not included. That&rsquo;s when I checked the details page. But overall a good set for beginners.</p>

<h5 id="luxbell-made-my-day">Luxbell Made My Day!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I bought the GoPro. Then I bought the accessory kit. Now I have a bunch of stuff and nothing to haul it in. I am not a fan of cases with foam cutouts, because lets face it, sometimes you have different pieces of different sizes that you want to take. This case is perfect. There are plenty of elastic loops to keep things strap down. There is a mesh pocket for your Memory card, instruction booklets, and chargers. You can rearrange your GoPro accessories in a million different ways. The outside of the case is firm without being hard, it is DEFINITELY waterproof, and an added bonus, it is super stylish. Thank you Luxbell. This case for my GoPro is everything I wanted.</p>

<h5 id="gopro-mounting-accesories-kit">GoPro Mounting Accesories Kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with all the mounting options and accessories provided in this kit. Granted, it&rsquo;s all plastic (and elastic fabric for chest &amp; headband) but appears to be well made. Although I have not had any problems, I would recommend the following: (1) when using the suction cup attachment, use a short leash attached to something just in case it wants to come loose, (2) when using the underwater floatie, use a loose wriststrap just in case you need that hand for something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>he got the gopro camera and I insisted for him to look around before he buys things separately and paying more&hellip;so I looked for myself since I&rsquo;m always on Amazon and found this and it was just perfect! Had everything he wanted plus more and loved how it all came in the little case which also fit the camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">Great Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a nice variety of ways to use the camera. Everything in this kit can allow the camera to be used in any conceivable way. The parts are high quality and we used the headgear right way and the chest mount and it is a fabulous set. The only thing missing; we need to find a bag or case to keep all the little parts together as the case that comes with the Geekpro camera does not have enough room for the variety of accessories in this set as well as all the great stuff that comes with the camera.</p>

<h5 id="kit-is-great-but-harness-was-defective-and-broke-first-time-they-tried-to-use-it">Kit is great but harness was defective and broke first time they tried to use it,</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I raised my rating to 5 stars because seller did try and contact me about the defective chest harness.The thing is I DO understand that a seller can have a great price and great service but occasionally have a defective product go out.They have said they will handle the issue and send a replacement if they are able to get one so I believe in being fair. So the 5 star is an update to my original 3 star rating.I&rsquo;m only giving 3 stars because the harness broke the first time our grandson tried to put it on. One reason we went with this set was because if items it included. I did contact seller but received no response, I was not going to ask my grandson to box up his whole set and return because of one defective piece, especially since I never heard back from seller. I just feel like if you are going to go to the trouble of buying a kit for a camera as small as a Go a Pro you should at least expect the quality of items in kit to work at least ONCE.</p>

<h5 id="good-storage-case-has-some-minor-but-important-issues-but-still-works">Good storage case&hellip;has some minor but important issues, but still works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a case to put my cameras in and all the extra mounts and gear. This case does the trick for a reasonable price. It seems well made and accomplishes what I wanted, so I gave it the 4 stars/I like it rating. However, there are two things that would make this even better product and give it a full 5 stars.Unfortunately, as others have pointed out, the handle was placed on the hinge side of the case. If you use the handle, all the items you placed in the net area will fall out of it. Simply moving the handle to the other side of the case would insure the contents of the net area stay in the net. I simply cut the handle off so I wouldn&rsquo;t make that mistake. The case is small enough to be carried without using the handle at all.This leads to my suggestion that you don&rsquo;t bother with the extra manufacturing steps for a handle at all and instead put a positive closure like a zipper or Velcro closures on the net area which makes that more secure and usable. I&rsquo;m going to try to do that for myself down the line.Until then, I will carry it zippered side up and store it in the same fashion.Overall, it&rsquo;s a nicely made unit for holding all your equipment in one place&hellip;I have 2 cameras and associated gear with plenty of room in it. It&rsquo;s not a case that will take a tremendous amount of abuse if you&rsquo;re going off trekking somewhere, but it&rsquo;s compact enough to fit in a bag or backpack to keep all your video gear together so you can find what you need when you want it. I may have rated it a little higher than it deserves, but it seems to be well made and does what I wanted it to at a reasonable price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-but-could-be-better">Good but could be better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall a good case. The only downside is the foam insert. I went to take my camera out of the case and the phone pulled out with it leaving all its content lying there. The foam insert should be attached to the case itself. A easy fix with some adhesive. But that defeats the purpose of buying a premade item. It fits most of my cameras equipment but it would be nice if there was more room for what does not fit. The case itself is very sturdy and provides adequate protection. It claims that it is waterproof however I would say at most it is water resistant.</p>
