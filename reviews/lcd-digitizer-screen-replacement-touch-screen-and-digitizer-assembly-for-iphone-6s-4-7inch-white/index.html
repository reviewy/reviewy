<h5 id="my-phone-looks-brand-new-would-buy-again-if-i-needed-to">My phone looks brand new. Would buy again if I needed to.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have no complaints with this product. It came in perfect, no scratches or blemishes on it or anything. Was relatively rough to assemble but it&rsquo;s an apple product - they make it a near impossible task to do by yourself anyways so you&rsquo;ll just shell out and buy a new phone. Luckily, I had some help with putting the whole phone back together. Took about 1.5-2 hours total. It&rsquo;s been almost a week and my phones been just fine. No lines across the screen (usually happens if you assemble it wrong), no major bleeding from the sides, no blue-ish tint that I keep reading about. My phone actually looks like a phone now instead of a cracked out piece of junk thanks to this product.PROS: Cheap price, would normally have to pay $150 and wait 24 hours at my local phone repair store to get my screen fixed.Good quality, little to no complaints on the functionality of the new screen/digitizer.CONS: Pretty difficult to assemble yourself and is time consuming. Thankfully, there&rsquo;s tons of info on the internet on how to put it together and the screen came with an instructional sheet on how to disassemble and reassemble the phone.Very faint bleeds on the corners, but they&rsquo;re barely noticeable. I only see them (note: very faintly) when my phone screen is open on an all black page. Doesn&rsquo;t effect the overall screen quality on any other colored background other than black from what I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

<h5 id="worked-flawless-and-now-my-son-s-phone-is-fixed">Worked flawless and now my son&rsquo;s phone is fixed! &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked flawless and now my son&rsquo;s phone is fixed! Only a little problem&hellip;I bought the wrong color should be white :) Now I have a gold Iphone 6 with a white home button and black screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wrong-ribbon-for-iphone-6">Wrong ribbon for Iphone 6.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The description list that its for iphone 6. After removing all the tiny screws, I noticed that one of the ribbons did not match up like my original. Then I noticed on the intructions it said for iphone 5. I believe this would be fine for Iphone 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="constant-battery-drain">Constant Battery Drain</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Giving this 2 stars because at least my screen isn&rsquo;t shattered anymore, and it gave all the necessary pieces and tools to complete the job.Now the cons&hellip; This thing must suck the life out of your battery even when the phone is locked because I lose about a % a minute not even using the phone now. My battery before the operation lasted all day and then some with normal use. Secondly, Touch ID no longer works even though I&rsquo;m using the same home button from the original.<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>. Invest in a portable charger if you buy this kit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="iphone-6-and-both-of-them-were-not-in-good-working-condition">&hellip; iPhone 6 and both of them were not in good working condition</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered two of the screens for my iPhone 6 and both of them were not in good working condition. One of the LCD digitizers on the first screen was damaged and showed darkness in the top corner of the display on the phone when the screen was installed and the second screen started to come apart between the glass and the digitizer. These screen replacements for iPhone 6 are cheaply made and do not last. It was a waste of money to order and buy these screens.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-replacement">Nice Replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had no problem sleeping installing this piece. Make sue you completely turn you off before you start the procedure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="turned-on-and-everything-works-and-this-product-is-brilliant-thank-you">&hellip; turned on and everything works and this product is brilliant. Thank you</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>At first my phone wouldn&rsquo;t turn on and I was worried that I did something wrong but then I charged it and the screen turned on and everything works and this product is brilliant. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-ordering-this-was-a-smart-move-it-worked-great">So ordering this was a smart move. It worked great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My daughter broke her screen. So ordering this was a smart move. It worked great. Like new!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-screen-replacement-didn-t-work-with-the-phone-after-it">The screen replacement didn&rsquo;t work with the phone after it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen replacement didn&rsquo;t work with the phone after it was connected. Took the phone to apple was advised the screen was not compatible so had to pay $150 for a second screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Saved me a lot of money at least twice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfecto</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install but the quality of the LCD it&rsquo;s very poor &lsquo; but still a good purchase</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It worked beautifully!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-don-t-mind-using-the-assistive-home-button-this-is-fine">If you don&rsquo;t mind using the assistive home button this is fine.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product does. It have a port to hook the home button up, nor the proper ports to hook up your frontal speaker or camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen is great only once I installed it everything rujÿ</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-product-is-not-good-at-all">This product is not good at all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is not good at all. The whole left side of the screen doesn&rsquo;t even work. I couldn&rsquo;t even type the letter &ldquo;Q&rdquo; nor go back because of the defect of the screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>1star</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-screen-causes-image-ghosting">Decent screen, causes image ghosting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fixes the non responsive digitizer i previously had, however the back light bleed and frequent ghost imaging of the keyboard (similar to the old CRT televisions) is very annoying.</p>
