<h5 id="major-design-flaws-mean-while-sometimes-useful-its-mostly-not">Major design flaws mean while sometimes useful, its mostly not.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for a road trip and ended up barely using it because of 3 major design flaws that are not immediately noticeable until you take a trip with it. I am not saying its useless because it did have its uses and that&rsquo;s why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1. The towel or tissue holder on the bottom was great and it does give storage options. However here are the 3 drawbacks I found:1: The side net drink holders are actually fairly short, so taller drinks have a tendency to fall out with any sharp turns or sudden movements in a car. This means that in reality they are only useful for sealed shorter containers, and do NOT substitute as cup holders.2: The cooler bag component itself is fairly crappy quality. Its not sealed well, both at the top zipper point and further down. In fact mine arrived with a stitching issue that was not noticeable until I loaded the bag up the first time. Is it useful for keeping already cold items cold longer? Yes. But its very crappy and anything that could condense or leak, such as a cold pack, will be a problem and you could be left with water seeping out.3: The way it attaches to the seats of the car is going to be heavily dependent on your car type. In a smaller car it sticks out enough that it can be an issue for anyone in a back seat. In a larger car it can swing freely more easily causing a higher likelihood of things falling or spilling out. Its not exactly very sturdily attached to the vehicle no matter how you do it or what type of car you have. I found the best option being to turn it around the opposite of the picture and have it sitting down the front of the passenger seat. But that wont work if you are traveling with passengers.Buy at your own risk.</p>

<h5 id="good-product">good product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product design is good, I purchased few other brands but they were all hanging(not hugging) on the back of front seat , this one because it has a stretch cord to fasten it at bottom keep it close to seat back, causing no significant leg room distraction to passengers sitting on the back seat.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="way-bigger-than-advertised-and-cheap-design">Way bigger than advertised and cheap design</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Way too big bag. Cheap and weak design. It won&rsquo;t stand the test of time and zipper is way too thin. It is much bigger than what it really looks in the pictures. If you have own a large car, it&rsquo;s ok, but if planning to install it in a small car, this is not the right one. It interferes with the rear passengers legs, leaving less space for them</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="car-organizer-is-great">Car Organizer is great :-)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice and sturdy product and I use the cooler part all the time with an ice pack.. I am in my car alot as my kids are all adults now so I attached this to my passenger side seat facing forward so it keeps all my items organized.Only complaint is the tissue box holder. I would have rather had another netting area as the tissue holder doesn&rsquo;t line up great and most tissue boxes are too big for this holder.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="disappointed">Disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received this package recently so I can have it in the backseat of my vehicle and when I barely opened the package, the top of the bag was already ripped. I have a Hyundai Sonata and even though it was ripped I was reconsidering buying a new one but bottom where the tissue is supposed to be is too big and weirdly shaped for a 2ply tissue. The bag itself is made weird and would not recommend buying this item for a car, maybe a truck or SUV but you get what you paid for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-okay-but-thin-and-flimsy">It&rsquo;s okay, but thin and flimsy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After I bought this I found a better one for similar price that had better STRUCTURE.. this is flimsy and just kind of hangs. The other one that is like this with the kleenex opening pointing downward seems WAY better, but may cost a couple of dollars more, but to me seemed like the better buy. I was trying to decide if sending it back and buying the other one was worth the hassle. I would NOT buy this again. Disappointed. It&rsquo;s just okay.</p>

<h5 id="ultimate-mom-car-set-up">Ultimate mom-car set up.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I always have cool drinks and handy snacks ready and waiting for hot, tired, cranky kiddos getting into my car. It&rsquo;s amazing what a difference a cool drink and snack makes on a long car-ride home. I gave 4 stars because the drinks don&rsquo;t stay cold all day, it&rsquo;s more of a &ldquo;reasonably cool for over an hour&rdquo; kind of cooler. It&rsquo;s super handy for throwing sticky, messy kid stuff that would otherwise get all over my back seat in this and it rinses off great. Over-all, happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-for-the-price-but-mine-was-defective">Ok for the price, but <em>mine</em> was defective&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s ok for the price. However, there&rsquo;s a cord under the tissue box space that you NEED to wrap around your seat to secure this in place, otherwise it just sways back and forth. This cord is two pieces, joined together with one of those little devices that you press the button, and feed the cords through the hole and release the button/spring. (I can&rsquo;t for the LIFE of me even begin to know what that is called!). Anyway &ndash; after one pull, the cords &ndash; BOTH of them &ndash; came unraveled. So, unfortunately this is now useless.Also, I was able to use it for about two days. I DID store cold sodas in the &ldquo;cooler&rdquo; part of it, and they did NOT stay cold at all. It was a normal summer day here in WI &ndash; probably about 78 that day. Car was actually parked in the shade, and I ran into the store and put our soda bottles in there for about 45 minutes. They were completely warm when we returned. Can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s an added bonus, really.I returned it, and will look for other options for storage for dog items and storing bottles of soda and other little things for short trips.</p>

<h5 id="wasn-t-a-good-idea">Wasn&rsquo;t a good idea</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Was a bad buy I only bought it for a short trip and for my kids to have cool drinks when in the car for an hour or so.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-an-ok-seat-organizer">Just an ok seat organizer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is alright&hellip; the bottom strap isn&rsquo;t long enough to go around the whole front seat like pictured. so had to jimmy rig it to hold on.</p>

<p>Very nice spacious and helps me organized my car clutters.it has tissue box and two pockets both sides.i can put cold drinks and water and not worried of dripping.</p>

<h5 id="not-a-perfect-product-but-it-works">Not a perfect product but it works</h5>

<p>Not a perfect product but it works. It does not hold its shape and hangs loosely to the seat. The tissue holder regularly unsnapes which causes the tissue to fall out.</p>
