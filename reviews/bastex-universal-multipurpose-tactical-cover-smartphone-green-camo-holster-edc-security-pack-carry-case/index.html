<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="you-need-several-of-these">You need several of these</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely sturdy! This is just what I was looking for. It has belt loop options on both front and back, and a canvas loop to attach a &lsquo;belt loop&rsquo; ring attachment. Everything in canvas and sewn well. This is perfect for carrying my cell phone at work, in the garden, working out, you name it.I&rsquo;ve had several cell phone &lsquo;pouches&rsquo;, and the wife has had a number of little &lsquo;purses&rsquo; to carry our cell phones, and this is the sturdiest and most conveniently designed I&rsquo;ve ever seen or owned. I&rsquo;m ordering several more to stash in the closet. And one to replace this one as the wife has already appropriated it : ).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="big-but-not-enough">Big but not enough</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was expecting this pouch to be big enough to hold my iPhone 7 Plus using the clip strap but it won&rsquo;t reach. It&rsquo;s perfect for the iPhone in standard 4.7 size. The two additional compartments are barely enough to hold the Plus model. I&rsquo;ll give it a try. It looks sturdy enough to use everyday. I think I&rsquo;ll carry a small notebook and sticky notes and markers and such. I&rsquo;m sure the front can hold a battery pack for extra charge when I need it. I&rsquo;ll keep this post updated.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-case-may-look-sturdy-it-definitely-is-not">This case may look sturdy, it definitely is not.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this in November and wore it daily until March. The stitching on the back for one of the straps came undone after 5 months of use. For something advertised as a &ldquo;bag that can be used as a small tactical EDC pouch, waist bag, gadget pouch, utility belt pouch, outdoor hiking pouch, or travel pouch&rdquo; it definitely does not meet those expectations. I would expect it to last at least a year or more under moderate to heavy use. For something that sits on my belt while I sit in an office all day, I would have thought it would have lasted much longer than that. While this case may look sturdy, it definitely is not. Would not purchase again and would not recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-good-overall-some-small-qualms">Pretty good overall. Some small qualms.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Positives:*Fits larger cell (L3 G3) really well.*Has 2 pockets, plus cell and pen slots.*The molle straps seem fairly sturdy, as does the outside and the zippers.*Very useful &ndash; will fit my cell, wallet, reporter notebook, pen, (massive) wad of keys, pocket screwdriver, and a few mini multi tools (Swiss Army Classic, Gerber Dime, mini pry bar, S-biner, DooHicKey), and probably more of I wanted.*Seems sturdy and reliable overall.Negatives:*Nylon pocket dividers seem too delicate compared to the outside of the pouch, and I think will tear eventually.*Molle straps seem versatile at first, but for a belt, there&rsquo;s really only one arrangement that works.*I wish you had the option of mounting the cell in the back because there is no way to put my keys inside the pouch, but farthest away from the body. If you have a notebook or wallet, and keys, the keys will be in the middle, or aginst the body, and either way is awkward.*Some of the stitching was sloppy.*I wish it had Velcro or straps you could use to keep things straight inside the pockets or a loop to anchor keys to.But for the price, still pretty awesome, and I will use it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-middle-pockets-easily-hold-the-larger-iphone-and-android-phone-models-as">The middle pockets easily hold the larger iphone and android phone models as &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this because I got a new, second, cell phone and needed something I could strap on my belt and wear during the day without thinking about it. The product has a front pocket that holds by my iphone 5 and 6 equally well, and two middle pockets that in turn have a small side pocket on them as well. The middle pockets easily hold the larger iphone and android phone models as well as a small pad of paper that I sometimes use. I note that they could also be used to carry a concealed weapon although I do not.The material quality is high, with good quality stitching, zippers, and zipper pulls. The belt fastener (two straps in the back) are held down by snaps that seem to handle things well and without issues.Overall, I am very happy with it. Roughly two weeks in and I am using it daily. I like the orange color (it makes it easy for me to spot in a room or if accidentally left behind) and have nothing but good things to say about the construction.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-not-perfect">Good, Not Perfect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can hold a lot of stuff! Only problem was that the grommet on one of the straps broke off the first time I tried it. Definitely not good.I thought about trying to repair the grommet myself but repair kits cost more than this pouch. Rather than trying to return it,I did a work around and attached an ALICE clip to the broken strap to secure it to my belt. I probably should have just returned itand hoped the replacement was better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-too-great">Not too great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pouch looked good initially, but the elastic to hold the phone started to tear at the top on both sides within two days of use. Just not very well made I&rsquo;m afraid. I returned through Amazon and purchased a different pouch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="strap-broken">Strap broken</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the buttoning straps broke within the first month. Contacted seller with no response. I would have given it 4 stars otherwise. Also, there is no way to wear this product without a belt. I did not deduct stars for that, but just want to make others aware.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-useful">Very useful</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the many compartments and how it easily can be attached to a stroller, a belt, and many other places.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made">Well made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is well made but to bulky for my needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-product">Amazing Product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It allows me to carry everything I need AND still leave my pockets open! Great material and fabric! If I need another one, which I doubt I will, I for sure will get another one of&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-hip-pouch-is-great-for-me">This hip pouch is great for me.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This hip pouch is great for me.I have a bad back and need a TENS unit fairly often. I was looking for something that I could carry the unit in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-small-pouch-is-extremely-sturdy-and-made-of-extremely-good-quality-material">This small pouch is extremely sturdy and made of extremely good quality material</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are looking for one small pouch for travel then look no more. This small pouch is extremely sturdy and made of extremely good quality material.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="can-t-beat-it">Can&rsquo;t beat it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks great strong material plenty of pockets to keep organized can be used separate or can easily be attached to another bag or whatever you choose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wrong-size-item">Wrong size item.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered one for my hubbys iPhone 6+ and we received the case/pack for a 6 or 7 (iPhone) - no plus for us!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="expected-cheap-so-it-s-ok">Expected cheap so it&rsquo;s ok.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that great but it does what I expected it to do and I am not really going to conplain since it did not cost much.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice pouch</p>
