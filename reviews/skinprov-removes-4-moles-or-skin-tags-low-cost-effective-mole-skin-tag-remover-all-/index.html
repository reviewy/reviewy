<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="really-works-to-remove-skin-tags-and-moles">Really works to remove skin tags and moles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stuff works well, Removes skin tags and moles quickly with minimal discomfort.You need to read the instructions and knead the tube first to mix contents. My first use it was liquid that came out, it should be a paste like consistency.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yes-it-does-what-it-claims-i">Yes, it does what it claims!! I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, it does what it claims!! I would suggest to use coco butter on the area after the mole falls off. It leaves a dark spot. I will be recommending this product to family and friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-wanted-it-to-work">I wanted it to work&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>AND IT DID!!! I had a large mole on my shoulder that I always felt self conscious about and I didn&rsquo;t have $500 for the dermatologist to remove it. After reading all of the reviews, I decided to take the plunge. The instructions are pretty clear but I had a question and they got back to me within an hour.Day 1: Used the emery board to remove the top layers of skin and then applied it, left it on for 3 hours. It was a little tingly, but nothing major. Washed it off and hit the sack.Day 2: Woke up and the mole is still there. It&rsquo;s a little red but not painful. I repeat the process that night with the emery board and apply more of the cream put a bandaid on and go to bed. A little tingly again.Day 3: Wake up, wash the stuff off of the mole and there is something happening. It hasn&rsquo;t scabbed over yet but it looks different. So I repeat the process again and left it on overnight. No tingles tonight.Day 4: Wake up, wash the stuff off the mole and there is a scab beginning to form. At this point, I don&rsquo;t know what to do so I emailed customer service and asked. They got back to me within the hour and let me know that I could apply it again. So I repeat the process again and left it on overnight. No tingles again.Day 5: Wake up, wash the stuff off and THERE WAS A SCAB!!! I put some antibiotic ointment on and covered it with a bandaid.Days 6-15: Kept it covered and put ointment on it. The scab took forever to fall off and it took everything I had not to pick it off. On day 15 the scab fell off in the shower. The skin underneath is pink and there is a small depression where the mole used to be.Days 16 to now: I have kept it moisturized with coconut oil and the skin is healing nicely. The depression where the mole was is definitely going away. The skin is a little lighter than the surrounding skin but nothing anyone but me would notice. The ugly mole is gone and I can wear a tank top without thinking everyone is staring at my mole.I am beyond happy and a little surprised that this stuff actually worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended">HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the best products I have ever used and saw immediately results. My moles (4) fell off within 4-5 days. Super amazing and painless.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works">It works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had tried other products with no luck. Skinprov worked on my ugly skin tag. It took about 4 applications, but it worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-mole-removal-product">Good mole removal product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked like a dream. Had a mole on my upper arm, within a week it was gone. Very pleased with this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding-medicine">outstanding medicine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a magnificent product. Have a little patience. It is fast and effective. By fast I mean threee of four days. Mkke sure you protect surrounding area with vaseline because the medicine is abrasive to the surrounding skin in sensitive areas that don&rsquo;t visit the outside world much.Apply once and wait for the scab to form. It wiil fall off. I cheated the third day and picked at a little and it came off immediately. Also it was extremely effective on a couple of small soft warts in the same area. However, they a a little more difficult. They will take six to seven days to submit. Wait 24 hours at least and you will see that the medication has penetrated and is doing its thing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>this stuff really works</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="as-advertised">As advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical at first but thought might as well try it. I used it for a skin tag under my lower lip. It just took two days to get rid of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="happy-customer">Happy Customer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked in about a week and removed my skin tag completely. Tried the Apple cider route but had no luck even after about 3 weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="painful-but-works">Painful but works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Be prepared for this product to burn your skin. It dries out the skin tags and eventually you can scrape them off but it is painful and will leave your skin irritated for a few&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="skinprov-works-great">Skinprov works great😁</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love, love, loved Skinprov. It worked amazing in a very short time. About a week from beginning to end. Everything healed nicely.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-this-and-you-won-t-be-disappointed">Buy this and you won&rsquo;t be disappointed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stuff is the real deal. I ordered it two weeks ago and it has already worked! When I first received it, I was disappointed because it&rsquo;s a small tube.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-ugly-a-mole-on-my-neck-is-gone-yessssssss">My Ugly A$$ Mole on my Neck is Gone!!! Yessssssss!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow. This stuff actually works. Just wow. I was skeptical, but it completely worked for me. Thank you, Skinprov! I will recommend this everyone!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-seem-like-a-great-product-for-lot-of-people">It seem like a great product for lot of people</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It seem like a great product for lot of people, but unfortunately it did not work well on my particular moles. They were light in color and very small.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-it-worked-like-a-charm">but it worked like a charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was very sceptical, but it worked like a charm! I wish I had taken before and after pics. I would definitely use again.</p>
