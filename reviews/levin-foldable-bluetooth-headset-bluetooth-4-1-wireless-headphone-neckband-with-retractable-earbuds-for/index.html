<h5 id="top-quality-headphones-bluetooth-is-the-way-to-go">Top quality headphones. Bluetooth is the way to go!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have several pairs of Bluetooth headphones, but they are all the over the ear versions. I wanted something small and not too noticeable so I could jog in them or wear them when in the grocery store shopping. The problem is I like the ones with the neck bar, but wanted something easy to store in my computer bag or car glove box. These were the perfect purchase for me&hellip; easy to pair with my phone (Apple iPhone 5s), the sound quality is great, battery life is very good, they are comfortable, fit in the ears well, and more that anything they fold up nicely for easy storage. I highly recommend them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="compact">Compact</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound quality and very comfortable around your neck. I drive a lot so it&rsquo;s nice to be hand free while driving. Has a gentle vibration when someone calls. Rechargeable thats always a plus! And folds up nicely when not in use. Push button yo retract the ear buds and has volume control on it as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-really-like-this-headset">I really like this headset</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this headset, its lightweight and easy to charge and use it&rsquo;s adjustable and easy to carry in my purse or pocket, I like the retractable ear pieces the sound is quality sound, and the battery last for a long time, I have several bluetooth headsets this is the one I will be usingit came in a nice box with a usb cord and extra ear cover pieces</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-headset-with-fordable-and-attractable-feature-beautiful-sound">Nice Headset with fordable and attractable feature. Beautiful sound.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am in love with this headset. I didn&rsquo;t know what to expect when I ordered them but I am extremely impressed. They feel like they are excellent quality. And let me say this about connecting them to my phone (Samsung Galaxy S6) it was so easy. I have never connected my phone to a Bluetooth headset before so I am not knowledgeable to how it is done however, I didn&rsquo;t even have to read the directions. It was that easy. Turn them on, turn the Bluetooth on on the phone and they just showed up. Easy as that. And the sound is extremely nice. I have other headphones that sound tinny but the base on these is awesome. I tried them with a few music apps on my phone and then decided to try my new Fire Tablet. The movie on my tablet was synced perfectly and it had the stereo sound with both headphones in. Very impressed with these. I have not tried using them for a phone call but my guess is I&rsquo;ll be just as excited and happy about these when I do.</p>

<h5 id="rockin-out">Rockin Out!!🤘</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely love these headsets ! I bought 1 for myself and 1 for my husband. The sound is amazing. I replaced our LG Tone infinium with theses when our LGs began acting up. For the price and quality&hellip;you cant go wrong. Will update if there are future issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-pleased">Very Pleased</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased with the bluetooth headphone. I like running and I have bought a bluetooth headphone before, but it is quit work soon. This one is sweat-resistant design, it really works for me! And also, it free my ears from the over-ear headphones. Recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-happy-with-it-and-i-would-recommend-this-product">I am happy with it and I would recommend this product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this product after having a bluetooth headset for quite sometime. What sold me was the retractable ear pieces and how it folds. I am happy with it and I would recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-headset">Quality headset</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a high quality headset. It is a unique design, it hangs around the neck with ear buds that retract with the touch of a button. It&rsquo;s comfortable to wear. It has a very sleek, attractive look &amp; folds up easily for storage or transporting. My kids can be pretty rough on their headsets but these seem like they can withstand being folded up and put in their backpack or pocket. We had no trouble pairing it. The sound is excellent when listening to music or taking calls. The noise cancellation feature works great. No issues with dropped signal. Battery life seems to be great and recharges quickly. I would definitely recommend this headset.</p>
