<h5 id="check-this-tip-to-avoid-fog">Check this tip to avoid fog!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Waterproof case is amazing! I go kayaking several times a week and needed something to protect my LG G5 along the way. I have used this case on several occasions and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier.A few tips:- Always test case before trusting it with expensive electronics. Do this by submerging the case in water with paper towel in it.- Make sure to place phone in case under dry conditions and try not to open the case during your trip. Opening the case under a hot sun after being submerged in cold water can result in condensation buildup inside the case and make the clear plastic foggy. (I discovered this after momentarily taking my phone out for a clearer picture. I don&rsquo;t think the condensation is enough to damage the phone but it makes it harder to see or take pictures.)- If you will be using your phone for taking pictures or texting while in this case try to squeeze out air before sealing. Leaving air in can cause air bubbles making it difficult to use the touch screen.-If you wont be using your phone&rsquo;s touchscreen leave some air in the case before sealing so that the case will float!I would definitely recommend this case to anyone. I am very pleased with the overall quality and build!</p>

<h5 id="a-travel-must-have">A TRAVEL MUST HAVE!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is incredible. I purchased to use while in Key West for an iphone6, iphone6 plus, and Galaxy S6 edge and it fits perfectly for each phone being a little more snug with the iphone6 plus. It is completely waterproof and takes great photos and video through the case but you have to press record prior to submerging the case underwater. My family went snorkeling and kept the case with phone inside submerged almost the entire time and had no issues with leakage. My family and I got stopped numerous times being asked where we purchased this product. Perfect even if just on the beach and you do not want to get sand or sunscreen on your phone and want to still take photos/text/browse internet while on the beach. I will be purchasing this for everyone in my family as it has become a travel must have! I highly recommend this product. Below is a screen shot of fish from a video we recorded while snorkeling.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-we-got-these-for-our-cruise-to">Amazing!! We got these for our cruise to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Amazing!! We got these for our cruise to the Bahamas and were able to use our phones as underwater cameras in about 10&rsquo; of water. Worth the price. Kept the phones dry. And took Great pictures and Video &hellip; even underwater &hellip; and you get sound, right thru the bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="test-it-and-there-you-go">Test it and there you go!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I dived 100 feet (30 meters) with it and the phone survived. Please, check it out first with toilet paper inside in your first immersion, and be sure it is safe. You should set your phone camera to shot with one of the function buttons, as touch screens wont work underwater. You should aswell shot every 30 seconds so your camera or phone doesnt go to stand by mode and then you wont be able to get the camera mode again, as touch screens wont work underwater. I went to Mexico and the best pictures I took are the ones about my diving. Thanks.</p>

<h5 id="survived-swimming-w-whale-sharks-canyoneering">Survived swimming w/ whale sharks &amp; canyoneering!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently got back from an adventurous trip to the Philippines where this dry bag helped me take photos through all our adventures. We swam with whale sharks in salt water seas, swam through cold canyon waters, jumped through cliffs/waterfalls into the bluest waters, and traveled along several islands with this bag keeping my iPhone 6s and cash safe and dry! You can see the white dry bag on my neck when I swam with the whale sharks and the photo of me jumping into the canyon waters was taken with my phone in the dry bag. No problems with it. Highly recommended!</p>

<h5 id="it-works-but-there-is-a-great-potential-risk-with-it">it works but there is a GREAT potential risk with it&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought it for a cruise I went on and I must say it fits great I can still use my phone and the picture and video still looked fantastic (all pic I upload had the case on)except the broken strap so I had it with me on the beach and it was but after being wet for a bit the small white string that hold the phone case to the lanyard broke and my phone fell to the bottom of the ocean luckily I was close to shore so it wasn&rsquo;t deep at ALl but I was going kyacking and that would of been a THE WORST IT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY GONE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN&hellip; I had to tie knots into it so it would hold if you can just make this part of the case strong It would get 5 stars but that&rsquo;s is a huge risk if you ask me&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="highly-recommend">Highly Recommend!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered 2 of these in blue and pink. I love the colors! The case is clear except for the edges so you can still take pictures with your phone while it&rsquo;s in the case and you can still text and use the screen.I was surprised that my iPhone 6 with the otterbox defender (which is really bulky) on actually fit in this case.I tested both cases and they are both waterproof.I was looking at the lifeproof case and I chose this instead. I really like the idea of this case because you can use it when you&rsquo;re going to the beach or any other wet environment. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s fully functional to have a waterproof case on all the time because it really impedes the quick and easy functionality of the phone.With this case, you can have your phone, or even other items, waterproof/dirtproof/sandproof whenever you need them to be.I haven&rsquo;t tried the lanyard that it comes with yet but I&rsquo;m assuming it is convenient when you&rsquo;re out on the water.I love that you can still use the screen and even take pictures, which come out really well while your phone is in this case.I like that this case fits my phone with its bulky case on, tooI took off one star because it&rsquo;s definitely a little less attractive looking and bulky than if you&rsquo;re using a lifeproof case or something&hellip; But like I said before. It&rsquo;s way more practical than the lifeproof and you can use the phone, also it&rsquo;s WAY cheaper than the lifeproof. And it gives you the added benefit of being able to waterproof ANYTHING, any phone, wallet, keys, etc.and it floats when in the water, so you won&rsquo;t lose your belongings!Love it! Highly recommend.</p>

<p>Many times have I bought this because it gets stolen. Many times has it never let me down. You can take some wicked underwater video and pictures in this thing, and no water ever&hellip;</p>
