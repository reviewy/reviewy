<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="thoughtfully-designed-well-made-excellent-buy">Thoughtfully designed, well made, excellent buy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this case to carry my Canon Rebel T5 with the 75-300MM lens attached. It fits beautifully, nice and snug. This case is 7.5 innches deep on the inside so it should accomodate cameras with the long lens attached very easily. The case contains three zippered pockets, two on the outside, on each side, and one on the inside of the lid. The zipper pull on the inside pocket tucks safely into a tiny sleeve so it would not scratch the LCD display on the camera. I really like that this case gives three ways to carry it, a belt loop, a handle on top, and a long, adjustable carry belt that detaches from the case, if desired, and is long enough to carry it cross-body comfortably. This case is very well padded to protect the contents within. Very good price, thoughtfully designed, well made, excellent buy.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-case-for-my-lumix-fsx200">Perfect Case for my Lumix fsx200!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really enjoy this camera case. I didn&rsquo;t want something big to lug around but yet have a case that would protect my camera (Lumix fsz200) especially when traveling. Not only my camera but power pack battery and charger fit in the padded case. It does fit snugly but I didn&rsquo;t want my camera moving around and I was also wanting a case that wasn&rsquo;t big and cumbersome. The side pockets are great for the chargers cord, filter and cleaning cloths so everything that I would need can be stored in this case. If you have a lot of accessories beyond what I have described you might want the next size up. I love the adjustable shoulder strap and handle. It also has a belt loop if you would rather attach it to your belt as a carrying option. The quality of the material it&rsquo;s constructed of is great and seems like it would be at least water resistant if not waterproof. Haven&rsquo;t had to use it in the rain so I can&rsquo;t really say that it is but I&rsquo;m not worried about getting caught in the rain with it. I also like the orange trim on it as it makes it standout and identifiable. Have used other Case Logic products in the past and have found them to be very functional and dependable. Would purchase this case again and highly recommend it if you&rsquo;re looking for a somewhat compact case. Also&hellip;the price was great compared to the big box stores and delivery was prompt.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-case-for-dslr-and-one-medium-to-smaller-lens">Perfect Case for DSLR and one medium to smaller lens</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a phenomenal value in a case to carry your smaller to mid sized DSLR with one attached lens. A big FF body with a very chunky 24-70 lens might be a bit tight, but easily accommodates a more compact FF body (such as the A99ii with a Sigma 24-105). It&rsquo;s perfect for those days when you don&rsquo;t want to tote the bigger lens bags (which can easily weigh in at 15-30 lbs) and when you can get by with just one lens. Pockets are handy for extra batteries, charger and/or straps. Highly recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-case-that-is-a-perfect-fit-for-the-canon-t3i">Solid Case That is a Perfect Fit for the Canon T3i</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>While this case will fit a wide assortment of SLR cameras, I know many T3i owners out there are looking for the idea case in terms of cost, value and durability. We&rsquo;ve had this case now for 2 months and I can safely say it&rsquo;s a winner across the board.There are many cheap no-name brands, but Case Logic is one I&rsquo;ve come to trust for over a decade since the days of cassette tapes and CDs.This one is no exception and you&rsquo;ll find that you T3i fits along with your basic accessories, although you&rsquo;ll need to do more homework if you&rsquo;re looking toss in a lens.★★★★★ By the way &ndash; FIVE STARS FOR THE ZIPPER ★★★★★All too often in accessories like these you get a crummy zipper that catches and doesn&rsquo;t open and close smoothly. No worries here. You&rsquo;ll find buttery smooth action that allows you to whip out your camera fast for those quick opportunities to capture those special moments.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-the-bag-fits">If the bag fits&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A utilitarian case if it is the right size for your equipment. I already had the smaller DCB-304 case for hybrids/compacts so I knew my Sony a3000 with an 18-55mm or larger lens would not fit easily. Unfortunately, while I have opted to use this case for the present it is a little too roomy for my camera. At the cost, I believe it is a better option for transport of a larger bodied DSLR but not necessarily the most preferable option for protection.The two zippered side pockets are useful for storage of extra batteries or cables and the top flap has another zippered compartment that works well for SDHC cards however the bag is not large enough to handle additional lenses. Padding on all sides is passable but with the requirement to place in the bag lens first, I wouldn&rsquo;t expect the base of the bag to provide a high degree of protection in the event of a drop or inadvertent direct hit of moderate force.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="same-price-as-walmart">Same price as Walmart</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice camera case. I have a slightly smaller one but couldnt fit my Nikon D5100 in it. its sturdy and has room enough to hold an extra battery and few small things. I usually buy from Amazon because ,partly for the price but after I bought this case I sawit at Walmarts for the same price. Walmart is only 10 minutes away from me. I could have bought it there and saved time. I like Amazon but feel that some of the prices arent really a bargain. The case itself is good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-not-recommended-for-long-hikes">Well made, not recommended for long hikes.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>During a long mountain hike with this and another similar design, L discovered that there was a problem with the nylon straps slippage, also, I needed two hands to open them as the flaps open away from the base so that you have separate the bag from your body and then work each zipper independently to get it open or closed. The design and quality looks great but the function could use a little improvement.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="offers-some-protection-and-tight-fit-for-my-setup">Offers some protection, and tight fit for my setup.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The material isn&rsquo;t really very thick so it doesn&rsquo;t offer much protection. I used it exclusively for my Canon 5D III + Sigma 24-105mm Art set up and it is a really tight fit.</p>
