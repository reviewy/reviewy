<h5 id="great-quality-low-price-very-small">Great quality, low price, VERY small!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are some of the best constructed bicycling gloves I&rsquo;ve seen. While some others are more substantial, the extra material increases the weight and reduces the ability of your hands to stay cool. The glove holds together very well. Unfortunately, the glove is made so that the bottom of the glove doesn&rsquo;t sit on the wrist, but rather on the bottom part of the meat of the palm. If you look closely, this can be seen in the example picture. This is uncomfortable for me, and even more so because the glove runs VERY small. I wear a US Size Large in gloves; I ordered XL and they are still a little too small. For reference, from wrist to tip of my middle finger is 8&rdquo;, and my palm is 4&rdquo; across just above the thumb.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-have-lasted-and-still-have-decent-padding-almost-2-years-later">They have lasted and still have decent padding - Almost 2 years later.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I will have these gloves two years in July, I have worn them for approximately 5,000 miles. I originally thought for the price they looked pretty well padded in the right place for my hands. I was a little wary of them coming over from China. But they have been worth it. They sort of look cheap to me, and they got beat up looking relatively quick, but they have held up with out falling apart and they still have pretty good padding after all these miles. I have seen new gloves that are far less padded than these are in their present state. I use them for cycling with my road bike. I am seriously considering buying them again (in July). I figure 2 years would be a good time to get a new pair.Update: 6/03/17 - Just ordered my third pair of these, just to have handy at this low price, though I don&rsquo;t need them for awhile as I have been getting 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> - 2 years out of a pair. For me these are the best cycling gloves (I have a road bike) I have had. I&rsquo;ve tried others (more expensive) and nothing pads my hands in the right spots like these gloves.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-of-all">Best of all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a biker. I&rsquo;ve been on crutches for a month and will be for a least another month, with more crutch-time to come in the future. Within days my hands were so bruised, swollen, and sore I could barely use them. A co-worker who bikes suggested biking gloves and I tried these out of desperation. Wow! What a difference a little extra padding makes on the heels of my palms and thumbs! And since the palms of the gloves are made to grip, I don&rsquo;t even have to hang onto the crutches as tightly as I used to. Best of all, they don&rsquo;t add a lot of bulk, like when I tried wrapping the handles with washcloths. I&rsquo;ve shown these to a lot of people in the medical community and they all say the same thing, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of that??? Definitely going to start recommending those to all my patients!&rdquo; As an added bonus since the finger tips are free, I don&rsquo;t have to keep taking them on and off as I move around the office working. My hands are much happier now!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="meh-ok">Meh Ok</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are ok for cheap gloves. They don&rsquo;t look like they will hold up to being washed so I haven&rsquo;t put them in the washer. The main thing I didn&rsquo;t like was the fit. I have pretty wide hands for a girl (usually get a medium) and these gloves are really wide but short. So they are too wide across my hand but too short and press in the webbing of my fingers. I think they are made for hobbits or something. They worked for the summer and definitely improved the hand discomfort for road vibrations but I&rsquo;ll buy a better pair next year.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wonderful-little-gloves">Wonderful little gloves &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Made my night after long rides pain free!I always had my hands numb &amp; stiff after long-distance cycling. didnt realize i needed this thing till i tried it, it just made the difference between ordinary cycling and fun ones!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-gloves-for-a-very-reasonable-price">Excellent Gloves for a Very Reasonable Price!!!!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are Excellent Gloves for a Very Reasonable Price. They feel as good if not better than many of the more reputable brands in the cycling world. In addition, they come straight from china and I received them in less than a week! Unbelieveable padding, which is what I was looking for. I highly recommend this item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-gloves-i-use-them-everyday">Great gloves. I use them everyday</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was guessing these would fit somewhat small, as most gloves I&rsquo;ve bought online do, so I ordered a size larger and they fit perfectly. Great gloves. I use them everyday. The little tabs on the inside of the glove make it easy to pull the gloves off when done. I wondered what they were there for at first until I went to pull the gloves off. Genius.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-plan-to-buy-even-more-for-friends">I plan to buy even more for friends.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good gloves, at a good price. What I would change, for my own personal preference:1) The padding is thick, that&rsquo;s why I ordered two more pair, but, I would like even thicker, and covering more area around the thumb.2) There is a single line sewn between the leather and the cloth on the thumb (should be two, I think). I had to re-sew one of the gloves when it started coming loose, after only a few times wearing the gloves.3) All the cheap gloves these days have a polyester backing. It is harder to find the old cotton crochet ones: I think they breathe better and absorb more sweat for wiping the brow, when it is so hot the thumb area is soaked.ps. Logo changed from CoolChange to Pearl Izumi. I thought the new ones I got had thinner padding, but this is not the case, because with the new (pearl izumi) gloves, the padding sticks out towards the inside as well as the outside of the glove. The new ones also have slightly better positioned thumb pads.ps2. Loose gloves are always comfy, with the added benefit that you can wear gloves underneath during winter. Order size larger, or two if you want to wear thin gloves underneath. They stretch after use, though I don&rsquo;t know yet if they shrink after being in dryer (low heat, of course).ps3. Darn, on the pearl izumi gloves, the convenient pull tabs are gone from the two middle fingers, so it is a little harder to take off the gloves.</p>
