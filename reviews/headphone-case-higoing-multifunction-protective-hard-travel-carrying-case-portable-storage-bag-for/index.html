<h5 id="really-nice-and-well-made-case">Really nice and well made case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really nice and well made case. Ordered it by mistake and ended up keeping it. I love it and my earphones fit perfectly. I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-case-very-protective-it-fits-my-earbuds-and">Nice little case very protective it fits my earbuds and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice little case very protective it fits my earbuds and Shuffle perfectly there is even an inside mesh pocket to store my charging cable. I can see using this to store other fragile items inside a larger bag&hellip;I only gave it 4 stars ..it does have a little loop to clip it onto something in your bag but it doesn&rsquo;t have a clip.You would have to get that separately, I use a carabiner. All in all pretty nice I may get another one</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does the job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was a good value at its marked down $5.99 price. It has adequate room in it for my Taotronics wireless headset and a short charge cable. I wish it was a little bit bigger to accommodate the extra ear buds (4) and earhooks (4) that came with headset, but it would be an awkward fit. As is, however, it is still roomy enough to hold a couple of my behind the ear hearing aids that I sometimes remove when using the headset. While the case is said to be hard sided, which suggests rigid, &ldquo;firm&rdquo; would be a better description as it can be readily squeezed semi-flat between one&rsquo;s thumb and forefinger. Still it should be adequate protection in most cases short of stepping on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-for-the-task">Perfect for the task.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this case to safely carry around my TacTonics bluetooth transmitter and a earbud headset. Both fit in this small case, hardened sufficiently to protect it in my workout gear bag. While mostly black, I like that the red trim makes it easy to find if it gets tucked into a dark corner.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-case-scenario">Best Case Scenario</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought a set of these jammer slammers for my wife and I to stash our wireless bluetooth earbuds, when not in use at the gym.Upon opening the package, I was at first concerned that the case would be too small comma but soon found out that the elastic connecting the zipper to the case body was very stretchy and had no problem accommodating our Jam Transits.Great little case for cheap!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-size-for-earbuds-ipod-shuffle">Perfect Size for Earbuds &amp; iPod Shuffle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! I used to break so many pairs of headphones from clipping them together with my iPod shuffle, but with this case, I can keep my headphones compact without damaging them. The case is the perfect size for my earbuds and shuffle. Highly recommend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="headphone-case">Headphone Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product I would buy it again, and recommend it to anyone who&rsquo;s looking for something like this especially for this priceWorks exactly like it should be not much to say about it! Good quality, reliable,easy-to-use made forever and It comes with very good price-tag!I would recommend to a friend!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sweet">Sweet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered a Bluetooth headphone a couple of days ago. It was junk. No range and minimal tone. I&rsquo;vePurchased Anker plugs and this is great. A litttle heavy on the bass (I play Free Man in Paris with Joni, Jaco and Pat Metheny and they all sound great). That&rsquo;s my test. Nice earbuds. Kudos.</p>

<h5 id="just-in-case">Just in case</h5>
