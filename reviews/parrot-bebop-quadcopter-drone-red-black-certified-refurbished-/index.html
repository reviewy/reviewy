<h5 id="good-as-new">Good as New</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As advertised. I think I spotted one visible tiny little dent on the underside of the styrofoam nose cone, and that&rsquo;s it. I had a brand new one of these (which I lost and this one is replacing) and I put a dent in that one on the first day, lol. All accessories that come with a new drone came with this one. Flies as expected, takes video as expected. No complaints here. Nice job.</p>

<h5 id="another-parrot-drone">Another Parrot drone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As with all Parrot products it&rsquo;s a little flaky at times. I had to mod the haul to block out light due to a know issue.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-it">Not worth it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tried to and both had issues &amp; the longer I had it, the more issues surfaced. Wouldn&rsquo;t hover in place, flies around on its own, disconnects from any device I used, video quality was poor &amp; sometimes it just wouldn&rsquo;t work. I do not recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="automatic-gps-flights-and-love-it">Automatic GPS flights and love it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t use my phone to fly. I use the flight plan every time and its exactly what I was looking for. I actually plan all my flights out before I get to where I will be flying and then turn the bebop on, do a calibration every time, wait for it to get enough GPS signals hit play on the flight planner and off it goes. I do limit my flight to around 2 minutes in case there are high winds but I always get enough footage to use within that time period. FYI one of the batteries I got only charges up to 54% so Its basically useless. Walmart currently has these on Sale for $199.If you want a quad to manually fly at a inexpensive price then I would suggest the UpAir.</p>

<h5 id="you-need-the-sky-controller-to-take-full-advantage-of-this-quad">You need the Sky Controller to take full advantage of this quad.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my initial review after a couple of days and more than a handful of flights- .After doing some research for something smaller than my DJI Phantom 3 that I could take on trips I didn&rsquo;t need the P3 and all of it&rsquo;s accessories, this seemed as if this could be a perfect fit for my needs given some peoples reviews and how the product&rsquo;s advertised. This is perfect to just throw in your normal backpack with the batteries and go. I seen and noted all the negative reviews but also seen some that said it worked for this same reason I needed it to, so I ended up taking a chance and as of now I&rsquo;m just not happy. It has a cool look to it, nice colors, the quad isn&rsquo;t too small or too big, and the camera is pretty good quality (another reason I chose it). Even though there is no physical gimbal like the P3, it has a 180 degree fish eye lens which lets you move the position and the angle of the camera while flying in the app, which makes up for it. It also does different types of flips which most gps drones do not so that was a plus since the kiddos think &ldquo;that&rsquo;s so cool&rdquo;. Now, onto my biggest issue and what worried me most was flying with my phone or tablet instead of a transmitter. Yesterday I charged all the batteries, my phones/ tablet, downloaded the app, updated the Bebop, and was ready to fly. The first flight was with my iPhone 7- Connected the quad, waited for the gps signal and then pressed the take off button becoming increasingly nervous. I then just let the quad hover to observe. It would not hover even within a couple feet radius. This thing would slowly sway back and forth/ side to side (there was little to no wind). However, when I went up about 20 feet it stayed in place very well for the most part. Not letting that ruin the quad I then started just flying around the no more than 15 20 feet away from me. I was also in a area with very little WiFi or activity of any kind so there was no interference. It was very hard to control and I&rsquo;m an experienced flyer. I&rsquo;ve flown a lot of quads and RC planes through the years and even played mobile games using a similar controlling system to move around (just saying I&rsquo;m not new to touch screen controls), but this Bebop just was not what I thought it would be. The controls seemed only partially responsive even after going through all the settings to try and improve on it, no change. Because of this I never felt fully in control and how much it moved around really didn&rsquo;t help. Though what I did like about the Bebop was all the options and settings available which could make for an even better flight experience, but in the end it seems like the only ones who would be able to use this quad to it&rsquo;s full potential are the ones with the Sky Controller. And that&rsquo;s not something I&rsquo;m willing to spend that much extra money on just to fly it properly. It is advertised as being fully capable of flying with just your phone. I also knew that since I did not buy the sky controller which lets you travel MUCH farther, I couldn&rsquo;t use this at long distances and for long periods of time and that was fine because I had something else for that. But even going more than 20 feet away was just too uncomfortable for me because of the worry of the quad flying away or swaying into something and breaking. And to top it all off both batteries barley gave me 5 minutes of flight time. The 7 minute flight reviewers said about was what I was expecting, not barely 5 and even if that. Even after all this I tried my other devices seeking a better result. While my old iPhone 6s was the same, the Nexus 7 3013 tablet (which I use with my P3) seemed to work a bit better, but ultimately ended in the same result of me not feeling comfortable enough to fly this thing. Tomorrow I&rsquo;m going out on a hike and I will be taking the Bebop for one last chance, but my hopes are not too high. Will update and figure out how to proceed.Update- I stick with my original statement. Was returned for a refund and bought the Hubsan 501S to take its place. Happy Flying!</p>

<p>I am horrible at flying toy drones. The Parrot Bebop is so much easier to fly than cheaper drones I&rsquo;ve destroyed. It makes remarkable videos and it&rsquo;s so much fun. I have flown it for a few months on a regular basis. I have to admit, although very easy to fly&ndash; I have crashed ia few times&ndash; even dropped it in the family pool for a second. The drone is very forgiving and still running strong. I AM on my second set of propellers that were provided, so I will be ordering more props very soon. I love my Parrot Bepop.</p>
