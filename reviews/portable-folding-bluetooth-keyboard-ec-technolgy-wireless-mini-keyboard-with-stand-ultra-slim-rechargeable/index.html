<h5 id="great-for-online-journals-or-blogs">Great for online journals or blogs!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this bluetooth keyboard with my Iphone 5s for almost 4 days now and I dont know how I functioned without it!I have a hard time typing on the touchscreen keypad on my phone and am constantly misspelling words. This keyboard really solves that problem. This item is a wireless, rechargeable, bluetooth keyboard that can be used with any device that connects via bluetooth! They keyboard is nice and compact, it folds in half and comes with a pouch for easy storage and travel. Even though the keyboard is compact the keys feel great and feels like you are typing on a regular keyboard.Connecting it to your device is simple. Once you charge the keyboard, turn the power switch on and then go to your device bluetooth settings and pair the device with the keyboard. After the first initial pairing you can quickly connect just by turning the power switch on and it automatically connects to your device. You can even turn the keyboard off while using your device and easily switch back over to using your phone or device touch screen keypad. It is extremely simple to use and connects immediately. I find it better to place the keyboard on a hard surface when using but it can be used practically anywhere.When using the bluetooth keyboard with your iphone, the phone keypad will not pop up on screen which gives you a better view of your entire screen but that also means that your auto correct will not be activated which has not been an issue for me at all.If you have an online journal, blog or do a lot of writing from a mobile device then you will want this keyboard! It makes typing long paragraphs so much easier and more natural feeling, faster too. The keyboard comes with an attached folding stand for your device and probably fits most devices but do note that if you use a lifeproof case then your device will not fit in the stand. I didn&rsquo;t find it inconvenient at all to just place my phone laying flat in front of the keyboard so you can easily use the stand or not use it and it is still great. I am actually very excited about this product and would really recommend it to anyone that does a lot of typing online.</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-keyboard">Fantastic keyboard!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am really impressed with this keyboard! It feels solid when I’m using it, and the size is just right. It is made of metal, whereas most keyboards are plastic. This keyboard just feels well-made and sturdy. It looks good and functions well.It has a built-in stand on which you can place your phone or tablet. I use a Samsung Note 3 and an Otterbox Commuter case. It fits just right into the slot on the stand. The legs magnetically stick when you fold them back into the keyboard, so they don’t flop around. The keyboard also comes with a travel pouch and a USB cable.I travel a lot, and I like to write when I’m on a plane. My laptop is not practical. This keyboard is perfect for my needs. I will be taking this with me when I travel. Even when I’m not travelling, this keyboard is easy to use and it is practical. I hate typing on a touchscreen. I prefer to have a hardware keyboard. This keyboard delivers.I’m including pictures to give you a feel for the size of this keyboard. For comparison, the phone in the pictures is a Samsung Note 3 in an Otterbox Commuter case.</p>

<h5 id="well-designed">WELL DESIGNED!! 🙌🏼🙌🏼</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome keyboard! It works so well and I love how it can fold in half and save some space! This feels like a very well designed product and the performance is outstanding! It is definitely a very stylish keyboard too! Not only does it perform well, but it looks awesome! It connects very will and there is no noticeable lag when typing. Overall I am very happy with this product and how it’s functioning. If you have any other questions, feel free to just ask me :)</p>

<h5 id="great-quality-folding-bluetooth-keyboard">Great quality folding bluetooth keyboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This keyboard is pretty amazing. Package arrived as expected. This keyboard folds vertical for easy storage. It fits in my backpack very easily.the size of this keyboard is so perfect, when you unfold it, it is wide enough for both hand typing. The little stands flip out only if you need them. There are buttons on the side for power and pairing. My tablet paired with this quickly with no issues. Get this if you have no need for a touch pad and only need a solid, portable keyboard.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-little-keyboard">Awesome little keyboard!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this keyboard. It connects on Bluetooth and is very easy to set up. It folds in half and slides into case. For easy storage! About the size of a small remote. Makes typing my school work on my iPad very efficient&hellip; love it!</p>

<h5 id="this-keyboard-folds-vertical-for-easy-storage-i-like-that-a-lot">This keyboard folds vertical for easy storage, I like that a lot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a few different keyboards to test for work travel and this one might be the one. This keyboard folds vertical for easy storage, I like that a lot. It fits in my backpack very neatly. The keys feel good when you type and are very tactical. The little stands flip out only if you need them. I don&rsquo;t since my tablet has a stand with a nice kick stand. However, I may go case less now since I feel my case just adds bulk. This would work great with the super cheap Amazon Fire tablet that just came out. There are buttons on the side for power and pairing. My tablet paired with this quickly with no issues. Get this if you have no need for a touch pad and only need a solid, portable keyboard.</p>
