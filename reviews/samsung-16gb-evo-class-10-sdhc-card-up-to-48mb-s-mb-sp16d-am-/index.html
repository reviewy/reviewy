<h5 id="great-sd-card-for-cameras">Great SD card for cameras!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a Nikon D60 and was getting tired of having to swap out my cards every hundred shots or so. With this 16GB SD card, that problem is history. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about carrying multiple cards with me, I get everything on one card and then transfer it all on my computer daily.Speaking of transfers - FAST FAST FAST! I use a multicard reader on my computer and this Samsung 16GB SD card flies through transfers with ease! I used to slap one of my old cards (1gb) in, go to transfer, grab a coffee and come back to find them almost finished. Now, with 16x the size, it&rsquo;s done before I get my coffee! WOW!I love the performance, the size and most of all, I love Samsung for making some seriously reliable flash drive storage options. I&rsquo;ve been a Kingston fan for a long time, but recently (past couple of years) their longevity has taken a hit. They work great, but they die after a year or two. These Samsung products have been going strong for years and they&rsquo;ve even made me a convert with their SSD line - they&rsquo;re just <em>that</em> good.They may not be the fastest on the market (There&rsquo;s one or two out there that can beat them on transfer speeds) but for quality AND speed? You&rsquo;re not going to touch them - especially at these prices!</p>

<h5 id="i-totally-thought-this-was-a-microsd-card-lol">I totally thought this was a microSD card lol.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So funny story, I actually bought this thinking it was a Micro SD card. That&rsquo;ll teach me to not read labels. However, I do carry around a Nikon D5200 and figured I could use a second SD card to compliment my Transcend 16GB. You can never have too many backups right?Pros1. Others wrote that it seems more rugged than other SD cards and I was ready to scoff at them for it (I mean really?)&hellip;but this does seem to feel more solid. On the packaging it has that &ldquo;shock proof, x-ray proof, etc proof&rdquo; and I wasn&rsquo;t ready to test all of those but this does seem to be of a higher build quality than my Transcend. It feels heavier and it appears thicker. Here&rsquo;s hoping I&rsquo;ll never have to test that.2. It records 1080p video without any hiccups or issues. The read/write may not be the best on paper but I can&rsquo;t record anything higher quality than that so this is fast enough for what I need it for.3. It seems like it&rsquo;s going to last a while. I&rsquo;ll update my review if it dies and adjust my rating accordingly but if you&rsquo;re reading this and it&rsquo;s 5 stars, it&rsquo;s still alive and kicking. To test it, I&rsquo;ll be leaving it in my camera and giving my Transcend a break.Cons1. Totally thought this was a MicroSD. They look freaking identical. That is, of course, my bad so no stars off&hellip;but still, maybe like a different color or something.2. Didn&rsquo;t come with a carrying case or any peripherals. I know not all of them do it but some at least come with a little plastic carrying case. I now keep my other SD card in a cleaned out Altoids tin because I have nowhere else to put it.Overall, this seems like a really nice card. I know the read/writes don&rsquo;t match up to others and that sucks if you&rsquo;re really into numbers (and I&rsquo;m a tech nerd so you&rsquo;d think it would bug me..but it doesn&rsquo;t) but it writes fast enough to record the largest files I can produce and that means it&rsquo;s good enough for me and for most people.

<p>I purchased this particular item by mistake but I have no doubt it is an excellent product reason being is that I have done my research and this item won&rsquo;t let you down it is intended to do what it does best and that is speed and storage and serves it&rsquo;s purpose as of my experience with these. I would definitely encourage you the buyer to give this a chance. The customer service is so great they even accepted my request to return it and get the micro sd version!! Satisfied customer!</p>

<h5 id="good-card-not-a-bargain-like-amazonbasics">Good Card - Not A Bargain Like AmazonBasics.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Tested it on a Nikon D610, D800 and D5100. Works fine in all 3 cameras. Pretty fast moving images back to Mac. The card itself is well constructed. The only gripe I have is that its not as good of a value (may be different when you buy it) than the Amazon Basics cards amazon used to sell. Those were always the best deal on Amazon. Still a few bucks more and you have a nice card.</p>
