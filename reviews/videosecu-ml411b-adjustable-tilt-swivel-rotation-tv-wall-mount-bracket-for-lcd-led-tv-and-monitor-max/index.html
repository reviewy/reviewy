Detachable VESA plate lift and hook design makes for quick installation. this mount comes with standard mounting and screen attachment hardware. Will It fit my LCD? * Firstly, please check the weight of your display, it should be less than 44 lbs. * Secondly, If your LCD Monitor or TV has 4 holes on the back of the screen that are either 75mm (3 inch) or 100mm (4 inch) apart from each other vertically and horizontally this bracket will fit.
Notice: This mount fits most 15-24&rdquo; TVs (VESA 75x75mm(3x3&rdquo;), 100x100mm(4x4&rdquo;)), some up to 26 27 inch TVs manufactured in recent 3 years</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="read-here-before-installation">READ HERE BEFORE INSTALLATION!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>READ HERE BEFORE INSTALLATION!! Overall it is a great product and a good value, but there is an error in the installation instructions which seems to have caused a number of problems for people, including me!The instructions call for using a <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; drill for pilot holes into the stud, which is just large enough that the included fasteners WILL NOT work and pull out from the wall. I learned the hard way and had to purchase larger diameter fasteners to use the wholes drilled with the <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; bit.Instead, use a <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; or <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; drill bit to ensure you can use the included fasteners.In the attached photos, you can see that the <sup>7</sup>&frasl;<sub>32</sub>&rdquo; bit when held in front of the fasteners is just too large &ndash; you should be able to see most/all of the threads but you can&rsquo;t. The other photos shows the smaller bits, incorrect installation instructions, and final installation photo!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-mount">Good mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The mount itself is very nice, has good adjustment angles, and is solid. I&rsquo;m using a 32&rdquo; TV on it (don&rsquo;t know the weight).Some notes on installation: If you haven&rsquo;t done it before, be careful. If you&rsquo;re a little off with marking the holes and drilling and driving the bolts, the mount will sit crooked or be unstable. I had to re-drill a few holes (luckily I wasn&rsquo;t wall-mounting, my desk has posts I mounted this on) in order to get it straight. Use a level if you have one. Also, the included lag bolts are TERRIBLE. I read this on another review, but I figured it may have just been user error or something - I had the same issues. Two of the bolts stripped out as I was driving them into pre-drilled holes, and I had to remove them with pliers (luckily, they have a hex head so you could use a socket wrench or something if you have one) and then make a trip to the hardware store to get better bolts. My advice: skip trying to use the included bolts, take one of them to the hardware store and get 3 matching bolts of higher quality before you start the install.</p>

<h5 id="the-product-is-not-well-made-or-well-packaged">The product is not well made or well packaged.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the $12 VideoSecu ML421B2 Tilt Swivel TV Wall Mount Bracket for 19&rdquo; - 32&rdquo;, Some TV up to 37&rdquo; with VESA 200/200x100/100x100 LCD LED TV Monitor Flat Panel Display Loading Capacity to 66 lbs 1H5The product I received had some differences from the product photos by Amazon/seller as well as user photos. The bottom hole in the mounting bracket is much too small for the lag bolts to go through. Installing a bottom bolt would have made it impossible to hang the mount on the wall after attaching it to the tv. The box has 6 panels of abbreviated instructions on the top, however these images are printed upside down. (the text faces the other direction)The adjusting knob is not easy to tighten or loosen. This made post hanging adjustments very difficult. Even after tightening it to the best of my ability, the mounted tv seems to have some give which is unacceptable. Not just that, I am extremely worried about the single screw holding the tv up. Only one part has to fail for my tv to come crashing down. Granted I have a 32&rdquo; Vizio tv that is on the higher end of the rated size (except the product page boldly says &ldquo;some tv up to 37&rdquo;) I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend others buy this for mounting a tv this big.This is an absolutely disappointing product. Stay away.</p>

<h5 id="works-but-poorly-designed">Works, but poorly designed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Came with cheap screws. The phillips heads appeared stripped out, and one was bent. Had to go to the hardware store and pick up some replacement screws for 50 cents. The screws I purchased were slightly too big, and I ended up having to ream out the holes in the bracket with my drill. This was totally my fault, but I shouldn&rsquo;t have had to buy different screws in the first place. Since this thing sits so close to the wall, making adjustments to the tilt and swivel once the TV is hung is impossible. I had to make all adjustments with the TV off, and kept hooking it on the wall bracket to see how it hung until I got it where I wanted it. Since the VESA mount hooks on the wall mount, and then is secured with screws, it made life incredibly difficult because there was simply no room to get behind the TV and secure those screws once the TV is hooked on. After much difficulty and frustration, I managed to get one of the securing screws in. I gave up on the second one, because I could not get in a position to get it started, especially with the poor threads on the tapped holes. One seems to secure it just fine, and prevent it from unhooking. For $10, I wasn&rsquo;t expecting much, but this really is a poor thought out products, and it came with unusable hardware. Giving it 3 stars, because after all is said, it works.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-easy-to-install">Great value, easy to install</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this to wall mount a 24 inch LCD TV. The unit has two pieces, one screwed to the back of the TV with four VESA standard screws, with the other part attached to the wall separately, then the two parts are easily joined and secured, making installation easy once the mounting location is defined.Once installed, the unit allows the screen to rotate in all three axes to obtain the proper viewing angle.PROSWell designedGood materials and finishValue pricedTwo separate parts make for easy installationMounting hardware is includedIncludes both 75 and 100 mm VESA patternsEasy adjustment for proper viewing angle once assembledCONSNoneWould use again!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-for-price">Nice for price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It took me awhile to put up but this 60 yr lady did it except for bracket to tv, have to buy longer screws( ones come in kit are half length needed). I took it apart to attach to wall. And used different size drill bit (another reviewer mentioned to). Would be 5 stars if I didn&rsquo;t need a trip to town for parts.</p>
