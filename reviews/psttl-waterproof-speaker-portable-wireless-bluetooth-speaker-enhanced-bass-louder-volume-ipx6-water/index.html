<h5 id="good-quality-waterproof-bluetooth-speaker">Good Quality Waterproof bluetooth speaker !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> A good speaker for use amid water and dust conditions(shower, beach etc.). The speaker doesn&rsquo;t look super awesome but doesn&rsquo;t look bad/ugly either. It claims to be waterproof (IPX6) and it actually is. I tested by keeping on shelf in my bath area, with splashes of water hitting it directly, it didn&rsquo;t stop working and sound remained just as same.I sound quality is good just may be a bit short of being excellent, I noticed on full volume the treble and bass were not at best. At moderate volume it was a complete pleasure to hear. I like the small hook it comes with, it&rsquo;s very handy if you want to take this around with you. Connecting first time to my phone was very smooth and it didn&rsquo;t take any time.I am uploading video as well where I played few songs changing the volume (from max in beginning to moderately high for most part). Hope it helps.</p>

<h5 id="for-a-price-like-this-it-is-hard-to-expect-anything-more-than">For a price like this it is hard to expect anything more than &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For a price like this it is hard to expect anything more than a generic Walmart speaker that blows its base after a few months of use. But it is sleek, simple to use, and holds charge for a long time. In terms of sound quality, this thing is more crispy than a frisbee&ndash; the bass is great, and the other musical elements could not be more defined and clear as if I&rsquo;m hearing the music from a surround sound system. It comes with a handy carabiner attached that I can easily just hang to a hook I have in my ceiling; then I connect to bluetooth from my computer and I have a little dance party speaker. I cannot express how great of a product this is, not to mention the generously low price point&ndash; could easily be sold for much more.</p>

<h5 id="overall-it-is-a-very-nice-medium-sized-water-resistant-wireless-speaker">Overall it is a very nice medium sized water resistant wireless speaker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the Psttl Waterproof Speaker, Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker (Enhanced Bass,Louder Volume,IPX6 Water Resistant)Overall it is a very nice medium sized water resistant wireless speaker. This speaker comes with aux input cord and charger. Charge time is fast (under 2 hours) and working time is up to 8 hours.PROS:- Water resistant- Big sound out of a medium size speaker that doesn&rsquo;t take up a lot of room.- The Bluetooth recognition had no issues- Sound quality is pretty darn good for a small, and inexpensive speaker.- The sound quality is good and the speaker has a good base/treble ratio.CONS:I thought I would be getting a pretty much waterproof speaker that could fall into a pool, etc. Apparently it is just pretty water resistant versus very water resistant. Essentially, maybe using it in the shower and it would be okay to have on a pool deck where it would get splashed but it sounded as though falling into a pool or getting very wet would kill it.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-sound-quality">Amazing sound quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband was the first to open this highly anticipated package from Amazon. We&rsquo;ve been in need of a portable blue tooth speaker for quite some time. The fact that this one by Psttl is waterproof was an added plus that helped to make our decision. Also, the price was right! I was folding laundry in the bedroom when I heard what I thought was the living room stereo system being played &ndash; loudly. But then the music kept getting louder &ndash; I assumed my husband was just cranking the volume of our stereo &hellip;but no, he was heading towards me carrying this little blue tooth speaker! It sounds amazingly rich! No distortion, and like I said, it can be played at quite a loud level! I am very impressed and so happy with our new purchase. We are even thinking about seeing if we can use it as a little portable radio (of sorts) on my husband&rsquo;s motorcycle. I bet it will play loud enough to be heard over the engine! The handy carabiner will make it easy to attach to the bike.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-wireless-speaker-for-the-price">This is a great wireless speaker for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great wireless speaker for the price. The speaker has some really good sound and bass for a small/medium sized wireless speaker. The size is perfect for moving around with me. I use it in my home office and my home gym (which includes a few 20 lb dumbbells and pull-up bar). What a great design! I have a bose sound dock and various smaller speakers and this is my favorite speaker for the price point! Having the ability to use the speaker around water (waterproof design) is super added feature. This has amazing and fabulous sound for the size/price. You can really hear the bass from this little guy, it shook itself off my counter top once while turned on high as I rocked out to Taylor Swift.</p>

<h5 id="this-speaker-sounds-great-the-video-reviews-w-the-sound-being-played-does">this speaker sounds great! The video reviews w/the sound being played does &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was definitely impressed w/the quality of both the product itself,and also the quality of the sound and the punch it packs.Even when the volume is turned up high,this speaker sounds great! The video reviews w/the sound being played does no justice for this speaker.The battery life does decrease when the volume is played high,but that I expected.I<code>ve had people ask me about it already,the first time I played it at work.Just got it yesterday.I was thinking about getting another one,but I</code>ve seen the price went up a little since I`ve ordered this product.Still a great price for those who are still debating about buying this item,and you will definitely not be disappointed !! :~)) Ray</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-speaker">I love this speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this wireless speaker! It works great with my iPhone and iPad. There is no interference or difficulty getting it to connect. I love listening to music while showering and since it is waterproof the steam does not affect it at all. The sound is great. I look forward to using it outdoors when the weather warms up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this-speaker">Love this speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So I haven’t found the perfect speaker just yet but this by hafar has been the best one when it comes to everything all around. The bald is pretty amazing.. the quality is great. The speaker itself is about the same size as a beats pill just a little bigger and longer. Very durable features and material. I have read other comments and I fear this speaker shutting down on me but I tried my luck buying this speaker. I really hope it last because it has amazing quality and it’s loud! Definitely a great buy for the price. So far, this is something I would recommend to friends!</p>
