<h5 id="not-perfect-but-the-best-player-i-ve-seen-at-100">not perfect, but the best player I&rsquo;ve seen at $100</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I find that the FiiO X1 (2nd gen) produces a full, detailed sound with more power than most portable music players I&rsquo;ve owned. It&rsquo;s also very simple to navigate. And although I&rsquo;ve been using it primarily with my Shure E2 (wired) earphones, it easily pairs to my Bluetooth earphones and speaker. However, there&rsquo;s a few drawbacks which prevent me from rating it 5 stars: First, the touch wheel is sensitive to the point of rendering it useless. This is related to another drawback, which is that it&rsquo;s easy for your fingers to accidentally swipe the wheel while searching for one of the four buttons on the front as they aren&rsquo;t lit. Also, because it&rsquo;s slippery, it would be nice if it came with a rubberized skin; as of now, finding one online is near impossible.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-mp3-player-for-audiobooks-you-might-look-elsewhere">Very Good MP3 Player. For Audiobooks, You Might Look Elsewhere.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not a true audiophile, who has to have to best sound equipment. However, I think this player sounds very good. I have everything from classical, jazz, country, rock, etc. and it all sounds good.There is no internal memory, so I bought a 128 gb micro sd card. I&rsquo;ve ripped almost 250 cds using lossless which has taken almost 80 gb of the card. Depending what quality you use, the mp3 format would have used from <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> to <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of that memory.The genre category is disappointing. I like to search for albums by genre, but this player only lists tracks in that category.I am also using this to listen to audio-books. Probably not the best choice if that is your main use. There is no bookmarking feature. The player can be set to start at the position you left off, but it has a tendency to jump to the start of the next track when you turn the player on or off. If the tracks are an hour long, rather than the 3 minute tracks on some books, it can take some time to find your last position.As an MP3 player for music, I would heartily recommend this player.</p>

<h5 id="for-the-most-part-files-sound-fine-without-the-assistance-of-my-amp">for the most part) files sound fine without the assistance of my amp</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received my FiiO on time and it was well packaged; exactly what I&rsquo;ve come to expect from Amazon. I&rsquo;m using my FiiO DAP with a portable DAC/Amp, so its DAC and amp chips were/are less important to me than if I were intending to use it alone. That said, I&rsquo;ve plugged in my portable headphones (Sennheiser 280 Pro&rsquo;s), which provide 64 ohms of impedance, and the FiiO provides plenty of volume, without pushing it to its max. The DAC is clear and detailed, and my lossless (CD quality, for the most part) files sound fine without the assistance of my amp. I suspect headphones with lower impedances like 32 or 16 ohm will really shine with the FiiO by itself.I love the appearance of the FiiO; it&rsquo;s case is nicely finished aluminum, and the face is finished in a matte material which covers the entire face. This includes the screen, which results in a slightly less crisp image; however, it also resists finger prints, which is a really nice feature. In my book, it&rsquo;s a positive trade-off. The controls, while a little less intuitive than other players (at least for me), work well and as explained in the manual (go to FiiO&rsquo;s website to get a more detailed manual that explains a lot more than the included info). I had to update the Firmware out of the box, which is as simple as going to FiiO&rsquo;s website and locating the correct download.A word of warning; uploading lossless files to the FiiO takes a while. I use a 128GB hi-speed card, and maxed out the space with lossless (mostly 16 bit/44.1 khz) files, and it took literally overnight and into the next day to load them all. That said, the process itself was very easy to start; it&rsquo;s all very well explained in the on-line manual. and essentially amounts to dragging the source files into the FiiO folder (in Windows 10, anyway; you Apple folks are on your own!)I like to listen to my music as one big random folder. This is possible on the FiiO, but requires adjusting the settings slightly in order to make it randomize the entire collection. Otherwise, it will certainly play music in the more traditional ways; albums, random within the album etc.So far, the battery power has been extraordinary. No complaints; I use it each night when I go to bed, and I certainly don&rsquo;t have to charge it each day. It&rsquo;s primary intended use is for air-travel, and I have no doubt it will work in this capacity flawlessly. That said, I&rsquo;m not planning any trips to Australia or China, which might challenge the battery, but such flights now-a-days typically provide USB power in the seats, so probably a non-issue for you jet-setters.This DAP suited my needs perfectly; again, I use it essentially as a transporter to my DAC/Amp; so its chips aren&rsquo;t as critical to me as to those of you who will use it on its own. If this will be your set-up, why pay more for a &ldquo;better&rdquo; DAP whose features you won&rsquo;t use? If you&rsquo;ll use it on its own with lower-impedance phones, it will certainly satisfy you.Happy listening!</p>

<h5 id="works-beautifully-i-know-its-almost-a-trope-at-this">Works beautifully. I know its almost a trope at this &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works beautifully. I know its almost a trope at this point, but this plays so much nicer than my iphone and is so much easier to load music that I&rsquo;ve spent the last week ripping my old cd&rsquo;s to flacs, and have been getting reacquainted with a lot of my favorites. Having some decent earbuds helps too, of course, but the detail and clarity of the play seems flawless, and I can hear a great deal more in the music.Not 5 stars for minor reasons; I would like the buttons if they had a little more projection or tactile feel to them. And the scroll wheel is a little hard to work sometimes. But then I&rsquo;ve been spoiled by the precision of my iphone touch screen. Also the supplied plastic case has all the quality of something you&rsquo;d get out of a supermarket gumball machine. The skins are fine though.I did have a problem the second time I charged it, where I unplugged it and got the two &ldquo;welcome&rdquo; screens then nothing - black screen, unresponsive. Tried a few things, but plugging it back in to the computer (it mounts when plugged in there to charge) it went back to charge mode, and then everything was back to normal once I unmounted it, like you&rsquo;re supposed to do with memory sticks and such.</p>
