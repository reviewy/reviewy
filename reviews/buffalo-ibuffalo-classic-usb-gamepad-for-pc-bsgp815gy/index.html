<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="not-perfect-but-the-best-inexpensive-snes-style-usb-controller-that-i-ve-found">Not perfect, but the best inexpensive SNES-style USB controller that I&rsquo;ve found.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the best inexpensive SNES-style USB controller that I have found.Is it as good as an original SNES controller? No. The buttons are not as perfect as an original SNES controller, and it&rsquo;s a little lighter. Some reviewers have complained of &ldquo;ghost D-pad inputs,&rdquo; and I have experienced that before. So, again, it&rsquo;s not a perfect controller! But, it is good for the price and overall good enough. Just please don&rsquo;t expect perfection, and you&rsquo;ll likely be satisfied&hellip;I&rsquo;m actually not sure where exactly you could get a &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; SNES USB controller, short of getting an adapter and using an original SNES controller.Since it&rsquo;s the best value I&rsquo;ve found, I still give it 5 stars. This is my default controller for RetroPie.Now, you might be comparing the two &ldquo;Buffalo Classic USB&rdquo; controllers offered on Amazon (as of late June 2017) and wondering what the heck the difference is between the BSGP815 (this product listing) and the older BSGP801 (Buffalo iBuffalo Classic USB Gamepad for PC BSGP801GY). I own them both.&gt; Size/shape: As far as I can tell, they&rsquo;re the same size, shape, and roughly the same color. The gray is a little grayer on the 815 and the gray is a little whiter on the 801, but I&rsquo;m not sure which one more faithfully matches the official SNES color. The cord on the 815 is a few inches longer, but they both have decently long cords. I&rsquo;m estimating, but maybe ~6 feet (72 inches) for 801 and ~6.5 feet (78 inches) for 815.&gt; Feel: They are very similar. The 801 is a little &ldquo;louder&rdquo; when you press the XYAB buttons versus the 815. That may convey a better feel along with the haptic (sound) feedback, perhaps? Hard for me to definitively tell. Performance difference? Also hard for me to definitively tell. If you want a quieter controller, though, it&rsquo;s the 815.&gt; Compatibility: The 815 is officially compatible with newer operating systems (Windows 10/8/7/Vista/XP/2000/Me) and the 801 is officially compatible with only Windows 7/Vista/XP/2000/Me. I have not tested all of these, so I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true.&gt; Writing on them: The model numbers are on the back of each model, and the 801 says &ldquo;iBuffalo&rdquo; on the front whereas the 815 only says &ldquo;Buffalo.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve included a picture of both controllers.&gt; Turbo/clear: I don&rsquo;t really use them, but to enable auto-fire for a particular button, you hold &ldquo;turbo&rdquo; and push and release a particular button. That particular button will now auto-fire when held down. To clear a particular button, use the same method except hold &ldquo;clear&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;turbo.&ldquo;So, again, just don&rsquo;t expect perfect &ldquo;SNES feel&rdquo; and you will be pleased with these&ndash;especially if you have tried some of the other poor-performing USB controllers.The only sort of addendum to all of this is there is a bluetooth wireless SNES USB controller that seems to have very good reviews. I have not tried it, but it is worth a look: 8bitdo SNES30 Wireless Bluetooth Controller Dual Classic Joystick for IOS / Android Gamepad - PC Mac Linux (Note it&rsquo;s roughly double the price of the Buffalo controllers as of this writing, and all wireless controllers inherently have yet another variable to contend with: wireless signal issues!)Hope some of this helps! Very happy gaming to you!</p>

<h5 id="solid-controller">Solid Controller!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this to play my SNES emulator on my PC. It works great! Feels solid, has a long cable and didn&rsquo;t need any drivers when I plugged it in. I just had to map the buttons in the emulator. Makes gaming a lot easier since all the in game instructions correlate with the actual controller. Feels solid, buttons are responsive. It&rsquo;s maybe a little lighter then the real controller but gets the job done. It&rsquo;s pretty much the go-to controller for emulators unless you use a REAL controller with an adapter.</p>

<h5 id="great-bang-for-your-buck-best-usb-snes-controllers-you-can-get">Great bang for your buck, best USB SNES controllers you can get</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For the price these can&rsquo;t be beat. Sometimes they run over $20 and I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s a good price (For around $30 you can get the 8bitdo which are better), but for less than $15 they are very close to the originals and have Turbo to boot. There&rsquo;s a nice long 6&rsquo; cord too. Works great with PC, Android and Raspberry Pi. I just wish they came in the US colors!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this product! I bought it because I wanted to play my favorite SNES games online. It just needed to be mapped to my keyboard and once I figured out how to do that I was playing my games!!! It worked very well and I am looking to buy a NES controller to play my favorite NES games. You need a program to map the keyboard to the controller just so you know. The best program to use joytokey. So glad I spent the money on this. I have prime so I received it in 2 days. I&rsquo;ve dropped it on my hard floors a few times already and no damage. The buttons press nicely, no need to jam your finger down on them, and the directional pad works well. I have had no issues with it. There is no lag when I play my games and it feels like I&rsquo;m playing right from an actual console rather than my laptop. I am very happy with my purchase, thank you!!!</p>

<h5 id="i-bought-two-and-they-work-good-i-use-them-with-my-raspberry-pi-and">I bought two and they work good. I use them with my raspberry Pi and &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two and they work good. I use them with my raspberry Pi and I get ghost inputs from both in the menus. The D pad will shift the menus left and right without me touching the controllers and it does this every time I use it. I have not noticed these ghost inputs during games. I assume they happen but they are not long enough to notice during game play. Other than the ghost imputs the controllers feel good and work well enough that I am happy with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-replica-for-snes-wired">Perfect replica for SNES wired</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is by far the best controller you can get especially for the price and the quality to the SNES controller original quality thank you very much IBuffalo for making this I will continue to refer you and spread the word for more controllers this is the third batch I have referred and reviewed for your company</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="arrived-defective">Arrived defective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Up and Down buttons occasionally don&rsquo;t work. Sometimes it skips about 1 in 20 button presses, and other times it can skip half of the presses.Some buttons can&rsquo;t be held without randomly un-pressing and re-pressing. This happens about 3 times a minute with the Y and R buttons. The A and L buttons are also uncommonly affected.Turbo gets stuck and it takes mashing clear for a bit to turn it off. I accidentally pressed this a few times (instead of select), and it interrupted gameplay.Tested on multiple computers of both Windows and Linux. Judging from the other reviews, you might get a working controller. However, Buffalo&rsquo;s quality control isn&rsquo;t the best.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-must-for-retropie-for-snes-and-nes-games">A must for Retropie for SNES and NES Games</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Retro Gaming? A Must if you need a wired controller!Pros:Same design as the SNES ControllerTurboWorks perfectly with retropieCons:Instructions were in Chinese or Japanese. Not an issue because setting up is intuitive.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>it works, not much more needs to be said.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-a-retropie">Great for a RetroPie</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought two of these for a RetroPie. Both work great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This works great &amp; is no my go-to controller for Hyperpie gaming!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-retropie">Great for RetroPie!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great with my RetroPie setup!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, cord could be longer</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="what-good-is-a-game-unless-you-have-good-response">What good is a game unless you have good response</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have never noticed a flaw in its control. Also, it&rsquo;s plug and play. Your windows or retropi already knows it (drivers).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="most-reliable-usb-snes-style-controller">Most reliable usb SNES-style controller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Most reliable SNES style usb controller I have used. Not the exact feel of the original, but as close as you&rsquo;re gonna get.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-3">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Plays extremely reliable on my PC.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="we-bought-four-to-use-as-presents-but-one-of">We bought four to use as presents but one of &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We bought four to use as presents but one of them didn&rsquo;t work out of the box and the others have a system error with retro pi where they phatom scroll.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="stiff-d-pad">Stiff D-Pad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As is usually the case with these things the D-pad just doesn&rsquo;t have the right feel too it. It feels stiff and takes some getting used to.</p>
