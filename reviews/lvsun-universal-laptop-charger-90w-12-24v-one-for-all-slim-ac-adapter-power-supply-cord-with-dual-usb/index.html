<h5 id="fast-charging-and-a-slim-charger">FAST charging and a slim charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I have two different brand of laptops one for work and one for home. It is important me to not have to carry 2 different chargers. There has been times when I grabbed the wrong one. This LVSUN laptop charger is a life saver. As you can see in my video it works on both of my laptop which are HP and Dell. They still have a lot of other outputs to work different other brand laptops. The charger is slim so it will fit nicely in a laptop bag too.BEST PART: These items come with a 2 year warranty. Only high quality items can make a claim like that</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sooo-convenient">Sooo Convenient!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great. We are actually able to use this with all three of the laptops we have in the house. This is a very nice convenience. When ever we would need to hold up in the bedroom for some project or otherwise, we would have to fish behind the sofa and pull out which ever specific laptop charger we were in need of. Instead, I have put this charger, and their adapters, in our bedroom. This way, we no longer need to unplug a charging cable, regardless of whatever device we need.This adds a wonderful convenience. We are very pleased!</p>

<h5 id="many-uses-for-laptops-and-more">Many uses for laptops and more</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually think I&rsquo;ll have a need for products that I consider &ldquo;techy&rdquo;, as in needing a higher understanding of information technology than I have in order to use. But this charger and adapter tips caught my eye because I have a few plu-in items that I haven&rsquo;t been able to use because I lost the charging cord. I see these are mainly geared for laptops, and those are high-dollar items so it makes sense to replace the charging cord to continue using them. One of the tips fit my old 2005 Dell laptop perfectly. I also discovered that I can use one of the tips to charge the hair-cutting clippers I use for my son. So that alone has saved me at least $10 for every time I&rsquo;ve taken him to get a haircut because the clippers wouldn&rsquo;t work, and I didn&rsquo;t want to dish out another $100 for a new set. And they also have a tip that works on my Remington rechargeable ear/nose hair trimmers. These are 90w, so you get a fast, full charge. And there are plenty of tips and a chart included in case you need help determining which one you need for your laptop. Hopefully you can tell from the pic how these are labeled to wasily differentiate between them.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-consolidated-charger-for-the-digital-nomad">Excellent consolidated charger for the digital nomad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great universal adapter! Having just started a new job that requires me to be somewhat nomadic with a laptop and assortment of devices that require charging occasionally, I started to look for something just like this. My company issued me a Lenovo laptop with one of those rectangular proprietary charging ports, but this charger included that tip along with its various options. It also includes 2 USB ports right on the brick which was what won me over.The beauty of this design is that when I have to set up shop somewhere other than my usual desk, I only need to deal with one charger to plug into the wall. I leave a small micro-USB cable plugged into USB ports, and I&rsquo;m covered for my laptop, plus my phone or whatever other gadget needs a charge. I also never have to worry about hogging the outlets in a conference room full of electronics-toting people.In a few weeks of use, I haven&rsquo;t had any problems, and everything seems to charge at the typical speeds that they normally do. I also haven&rsquo;t noticed any buzzing or excessive heat coming from the charging brick.</p>

<h5 id="nice-charger-excellent-customer-service">Nice charger, excellent customer service</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I found the LVSUN charger, and it looked good compared to competitors. So I sent an email to market@enlvsun.com asking for help figuring out which tip I needed for my older model laptop. I received a prompt reply explaining just which tip I needed, as well as a pointer to the right add-on package of extra tips and a discount for purchasing it. I ordered, and the item arrived when expected and, better still, works just as expected.Plus: Slim profile, two USB charging ports along with the main line to the laptopMinus: Tight connections between tip and cord made it a bit difficult to connect them, but they are unlikely to come apart. Also, the velcro strap is not affixed to the cord, it&rsquo;s just loose. I lost it &ndash; literally &ndash; on my first day of use. (That&rsquo;s what those lettuce wrappers from the grocery store are for, right?)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-service-and-performance">Excellent Service and Performance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to consolidate my power supply needs for all my devices into 1 universal unit anywhere in the world, and to stop schlepping 3 different chargers when traveling, especially now that aviation security protocols are becoming more restrictive. Imagine my disappointment when none of the tips fit my non US, higher spec Asian Dual Language Keyboard Lenovo. Apparently non US models have different power supply hardware also. I contacted LVSUN with my model number and asked for a link to different tips on Amazon, so I can order the correct tip. They responded within 5 hours with the confirmation, a link, and an order coupon. EXCELLENT! Great customer service; Very happy.Take the extra step and send them an email before ordering and they will advise you on the correct tip for your unit, and save you a lot of grief, and having a set of tips laying about needlessly.The USB charger ports worked fine with my Android Phone and Tab, and I suspect that they are the newer types that shut off power consumption when it is not needed.Highly recommended.</p>

<h5 id="get-it-seriously-get-it-great-purchase">Get it. Seriously, get it. Great purchase.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So my original charger got stolen and I was freaking out. I needed a new charger but laptop charger are pretty expensive for some reason. At least the good quality ones are. I bought this and it came right on time. Especially since I had a power point due that week. I also love the fact that I can charge other devices whole charging my laptop. Best purchase I ever made. Get it. You won&rsquo;t regret it&hellip;&hellip;unless it doesn&rsquo;t fit your laptop but seriously other than that. It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>
