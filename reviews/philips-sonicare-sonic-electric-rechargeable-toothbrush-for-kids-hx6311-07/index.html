<h5 id="just-as-wonderful-as-the-previous-model">Just as wonderful as the previous model&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have two children, and they&rsquo;ve been using the previous model of this toothbrush, Philips Sonicare HX6311/02 Sonicare for Kids Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, for almost two years. We originally started with Sonicare for Kids at our dentist&rsquo;s recommendation, and since we made the switch, have had nothing but positive comments from our dental hygenists about how well the kids are brushing. Sonicare makes it easy.Anyway, this new version of Sonicare for Kids is almost identical to the previous model. It&rsquo;s blue instead of red, and comes with eight new faceplates to let your child personalize, but it has the same physical body, uses the same charger and toothbrush heads, and - as far as I can tell - has the same motor inside as the previous model. It gives you the option of two different levels of vibration, and features a two-minute timed brushing cycle with beeps every 30 seconds to remind you to switch the brush to a new quadrant of your mouth. If your child has never used a sonic toothbrush before, I highly recommend starting at the lower level of vibration - it&rsquo;s very tickly till you get used to it - and using the training setting, which starts out with shorter brush cycles and gradually builds up to the full two minutes of brushing over a couple of weeks.Though Sonicare hasn&rsquo;t made too many changes to their wonderful toothbrush, there are a couple of minor differences worth mentioning. First, the beeps that let you know when it&rsquo;s time to change where you&rsquo;re brushing play much, much more softly than on the old model, and that&rsquo;s a change that I love. On the negative side, while the former toothbrush came packaged with two different sized brush heads - one smaller sized for kids age 4-7, and one larger sized for kids age 7-10 - this new model came with only the larger sized head. That&rsquo;s probably okay if you have an older child, but if you have a younger one, I highly recommend trying out the smaller sized &ldquo;Compact&rdquo; head, Philips Sonicare HX6032/94 2 Piece Kids Brush Head, Compact. My 11 year old son has been using the larger brush heads for several years, but I greatly prefer the smaller heads for my 7 year old, because they fit in her little mouth so much better.</p>

<p>These are great for kids. My 4 and 7 year old enjoy these toothbrushes. They are also very effective at brushing teeth. Would recommend.For my 4 year old i ordered these small brush tips (see picture):<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CVTVV4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CVTVV4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1</a></p>

<h5 id="excellent-toothbrush-for-difficult-autistic-3-year-old">Excellent toothbrush for difficult autistic 3 year old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Brushing the teeth of our autistic 3 year old is a NIGHTMARE!! We have already had to have some sedation dentistry done and I don&rsquo;t want to end up there again. He has to be pinned down completely to brush his teeth and even then keeps just to clamp down. A pediatric dentist friend suggested we try one of these to help. He thought our son might like the vibration and it might make things easier. I should have known better not to try brushing his teeth with it right out of the box. He was terrified!! I put it away for a couple weeks then took it out again but only to let him &ldquo;play with&rdquo; and hold and turn it on and off. He enjoyed that a lot and became comfortable with the idea of it for a couple weeks before we tried brushing his teeth with it again. The result was much better. He wasn&rsquo;t terrified, but he reacted the same way he does to manual brushing. HOWEVER this toothbrush maximizes the amount of time we have in his mouth much better than the manual toothbrush and gets a more thorough clean. I would highly recommend this toothbrush for other parents who have a hell of a time brushing their kids teeth!</p>

<h5 id="the-app-is-a-blessing">The app is a blessing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is really great for children though the children brush replacements seem kind of expensive.We have issues with getting our 8 year old to brush his teeth, infact he doesn&rsquo;t even like the vibration of this in his mouth. BUT the app it came with really helped him get used to it.After a few weeks he will brush on his own about 5 out of 7 days of the week, more importantly is he will brush for the timed duration of the device as it will stay on for about 2 minutes. This is the important part as before it might be a half attempt of brushing and 30 seconds he is done, then the fighting starts.This really helped us get our 8 year old to brush and recommend for any family having issues with their little ones brushing.</p>

<h5 id="made-a-serious-impact-on-my-daughter-s-dental-health">Made a Serious Impact on My Daughter&rsquo;s Dental Health</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Growing-up, I really hated brushing my teeth. Now that I am older and have had a few cavities filled, I understand the value in instilling good dental hygiene onto my children so that they don&rsquo;t have to suffer through some of the nasty dental problems I have had. I decided to switch from a manual toothbrush a few years ago to a good quality electronic one, and have had amazing results This brush has made brushing fun and easy for my daughter, while also doing an extremely good job as well.My daughter had some serious ear infection problems when she was little before getting tubes put in, and all of the antibiotics and steroids that she had to take while a baby caused the enamel on her back 4 teeth not to form properly. This, apparently, is rather common and led to her having cavities in those teeth. Since having those fixed, she has also been concurrently using this toothbrush, and on her most recent visit to the dentist, I am happy to report that her dental health is the best it has ever been. I believe that this toothbrush has something to do with that.So, as a father who didn&rsquo;t do a particularly good job brushing his own teeth growing up, I am happy to report this this toothbrush makes brushing fun for my daughter, and also does a hell of a job keeping her dental health at a very high level! I highly recommend.</p>
