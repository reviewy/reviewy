<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-highly-worthwhile-upgrade-to-the-oppo-bdp-103">A highly worthwhile upgrade to the Oppo BDP-103</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered my UDP-203 as a pre-order directly from Oppo and received it several days later. This is my third Oppo player and I remain very pleased with their customer service and response time during email communications. My connection is through a Marantz 8802 processor to an LG65EF9500. As with the 103 that I was using earlier, I set up the 203 so that one HDMI cable goes directly to the TV, bypassing any processing entirely, with another going to the processor for audio processing and distribution to a Martin-Logan setup.Oppo has made some changes with the 203. The obvious one, of course, is the additional availability of UHD disc capabilities as well as the inclusion of upscaling to UHD from lower resolution sources. What this means for those with 4K monitor access is an immediate improvement in apparent image quality for all DVD and Blu-ray playback. That alone is worth the price of purchase. Remember that Oppos generally appear to hold their value quite well, so rather than thinking of this as a $550 purchase, I looked at it as a $150 upgrade to my existing 103. The next big change to the 203 is an improvement in high-resolution audio. I suspect fewer individuals will take advantage of this, but if you&rsquo;ve had a chance to listen to an identical piece of music on both standard CD and from high-resolution sources, you&rsquo;d quickly realize this is like the difference between DVD and Blu-Ray. Don&rsquo;t skip over this if you purchase the 203.Another big change with the 203 has been the removal of streaming services such as Netflix. Of course, most purchases of the 203 will be made by individuals with a 4K TV from Samsung, LG, or others, all of which I know of have streaming services built in to their own firmware. So there&rsquo;s really no need to have it here as well. I don&rsquo;t miss it, but recognize that if you are used to using the streaming on your older 103, you&rsquo;ll have to change your habits with the transition.Don&rsquo;t forget, Oppo nearly always releases a second model immediately after a unit like this comes out. The second model, in this case the UDP-205, will provide superior analog audio output IF that&rsquo;s the way you choose to make your connection to your hifi. If you&rsquo;re going to use the HDMI, save your pennies and just get the 203.The overall connectivity is easy. The UDP-203 simply plugged into my system and within a few minutes I was up and running. The default settings are nearly all correct for the majority of folks out there, but those who like to fiddle can do so to their heart&rsquo;s content. The remote is roughly identical to the prior iterations. The Netflix button has been removed, and the light now comes on for a few moments whenever the remote is moved. The remote seems to be seen more easily by the 203 than it was by prior units from Oppo, and the Oppo disc loading process is faster than any other DVD or Blu-Ray player I&rsquo;ve used. Playback of DVD&rsquo;s, Blu-Rays, CDs, and a variety of alternative sources and USB flash drives all works smoothly and easily.As with prior Oppo units, upgrades to firmware automatically are received through wifi, through an Ethernet connection, or can be downloaded to flash drives. Upgrades to the instructions are made available regularly. And unlike similar firmware updates for other audio components, these actually install easily and without any difficulty on the part of the end-user.</p>

<h5 id="oppo-makes-the-best-video-disc-player-available">Oppo makes the best video disc player available.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A great solution if you are running a Sonos Playbar that only decodes Dolby Digital for surround sound. So many discs only have a choice of DTS-HD for surround sound and this give you the option for the audio optical digital output to be done in Dolby Digital. That way, if your disc has surround in DTS-HD, you can still get it with Dolby Digital and not have to &lsquo;dumb it down&rsquo; to LPCM stereo. That, and it will play pretty much any disc you want.</p>

<h5 id="didn-t-work-customer-service-not-customer-friendly-no-more-oppo-for-me-after-years-of-using-the-top-model">Didn’t work, Customer Service not customer friendly - no more Oppo for me after years of using the top model</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Didn’t send a signal through hdmi, Oppo was difficult to deal with - even though I had the previous model and was very happy with it, just wanted the new version. Finally sent it back for refund, don’t think I will any more products from them, customer service is not what I expect from a company like this. I was expecting pre-exchange like any other company does or easy return and rebuy without jumping through hoops and sending emails after emails. Not worth the hassle.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is ,for the money, the best digital player on the market. Everything else is mostly either cheap junk or overpriced audiophile nonsense.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="another-oppo-homerun">ANOTHER OPPO HOMERUN</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this from OPPO. Why anyone would want to pay more, than the base price. This is my 3rd OPPO. First one did DVD&rsquo;s, Second was a 93 model which did Blu-ray &amp; 3d, &amp; now this. Bought a LG 4K OLED 65&rdquo; TV and the picture looked so good I was thinking about getting a 4k Player. Then OPPO popped up with this UDP-203 model. I bought a 4k Denon receiver, then per-ordered this OPPO. Between the TV &amp; the player it is amazing. It is like watching events happen through your window. Watching The Revenant it was like you could reach out &amp; touch the person. I have not change any settings on the OPPO. On the TV I changed the DE-JUDDER to 3. That stopped the ghosting I was seeing.SACD &amp; DVD-Audio music disc sound amazing. I have a 5.1 set up. It must sound even better if you have 7.1 setup.You can read the reviews from better folks then me on the net. All I know is I love the eye &amp; ear candy this machine provides.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding-quality">Outstanding Quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I returned to buying Oppo equipment for this 4K upgrade. I wish I had been buying their players for the last seven years too.I stream most of my movies, but will come back to discs and route streaming through the 203 because of it&rsquo;s outstanding videoand especially sound processing. Paired with my Denon receiver, the 203 blows you away with its excellent play.I had a minor issue with my player and Oppo customer service resolved it very quickly; I can&rsquo;t say enough how professionally theywere.So, if you need a 4K upgrade, look no further than Oppo&rsquo;s 203. You&rsquo;ll be impressed!</p>

<h5 id="i-feel-like-i-ve-been-cheated-watching-movies-on-anything-other-than">I feel like I&rsquo;ve been cheated watching movies on anything other than &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This UHD Blu-ray player lives up to every review it has had written about it. The thing is a tank in build quality. It has a user friendly GUI, and the picture and sound processing capabilities of this player are lightyears ahead of anything else on the market. I watched the same movie, on the same TV, on a Samsung 8500 UHD player, and then on this Oppo Player, and it was an out of this world experience. I feel like I&rsquo;ve been cheated watching movies on anything other than the Oppo Player. If you are in the market for a UHD Blu-ray Player, get the Oppo, you will not be disappointed!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="still-the-best">Still the best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have owned the Samsung, Pioneer and Xbox S 4K players and none of them come close. I own a Oppo bdp-93 and it performes better then any other Blu-Ray player I have owned so I am not surprised how good this one is. The video and sound where awesome. This purchase is a no brainer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-great-it-won-t-play-iso">Not great. It won&rsquo;t play ISO</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not great. It won&rsquo;t play ISO. Disappointing for the price. You still need to buy software to fully utilize it to play ISO.</p>
