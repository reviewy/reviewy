<h5 id="disappointed-by-performance-with-usb-3-0">Disappointed by performance with USB 3.0</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, with it&rsquo;s USB 3.0 connectivity, and all the touting about the relatively decent graphics performance, I was very much looking forward to this for use on my ASUS Zenbook UX31A with a 3rd generation Intel I5 processor (which as I said, has USB 3.0 Super speed ports). This was connected to a 24&rdquo; Samsung display at 1080p resolution.The good:- Well made and balanced - stays upright pretty easily- I do appreciate how Plugable uses the Displaylink drivers directly - always gives you the latest version of it- Drivers installed flawlessly and without a rebootThe not so good:- There is still noticeable lag in the mouse and keyboard actions- Dragging things like Windows around your desktop also cause lag, along with tearing of the image. A big bump in CPU use is also noted when this happens- Youtube drops many, many frames in 720p, and there is compression appliedFor regular Excel, and Word, this may prove ideal, but I think I will return the device, and make do with a regular USB 3.0 dock with a USB sound card, and Ethernet adapter, with the penalty of having to plug one additional thing in every time (the HDMI port on my laptop). It&rsquo;s just the laws of computing (cramming 1080p video bandwidth down a USB pipe) that is the limitation.UPDATE 10/3/2012I received an email from Plugable after they had read my review and suggested one key change: That I enable Aero desktop in Windows. Apparently non-Aero Windows (such as the Windows Classic theme I was using) are not accelerated by the GPU and instead are rendered by the CPU. After doing this, the lag and compression artifacts decreased significantly - almost to imperceptible levels, and large spikes in CPU were no longer present. I was also able to watch Youtube videos without dropped frames in HD. I am awarding two additional stars, one that represents the performance of the product, and the other for the excellent, and unprompted customer service that Plugable provides. I also failed to mention that I had a 3TB USB 3.0 hard drive plugged in to the device as well, with no noticeable issues or performance hit.</p>

<h5 id="like-magic">Like Magic.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! I use this with my Microsoft Surface Pro 3 as a &ldquo;home base.&rdquo; All the reviews pointed me in this direction rather than the official Microsoft Surface dock, and I&rsquo;m glad I went this way. Plugged into this docking station I have two external widescreen monitors (one running HDMI to HDMI, the other DVI to DVI, both at 1920x1080 - no discernible difference between the two monitors), wired ethernet, another USB 2.0 4-port hub to connect non-power-sucking peripherals (keyboard, mouse, card reader), audio out, and a USB 3.0 card reader. A single USB 3.0 plug runs to my Surface to lasso all of this together. When I want to leave the house with my tablet, I unplug it and run. When I come back and want to work at my desktablet &ldquo;workstation,&rdquo; I plug it back in and everything magically works. Can&rsquo;t imagine living a mobile lifestyle without this.</p>

<h5 id="the-plugable-ud-3900-and-surface-pro-2-go-great-together">The Plugable UD-3900 and Surface Pro 2 go great together</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently bought a Surface Pro 2 (running Windows 8.1) with the hopes of using it as my daily driver. The Surface&rsquo;s lack of ports is a real problem when used as a desktop machine especially to a guy like me that measures his manliness by the number of monitors he&rsquo;s using. There is the official Surface Deck, which is a sexy piece of machinery, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, but it&rsquo;s $200, not available right now, and itself has frustrating ports. For instance, while you can connect two monitors to the Surface dock, you have to do it by daisy chaining monitors off of the DisplayPort. Who has time for all that? And my existing monitors don&rsquo;t have DisplayPort connections anyway. What&rsquo;s a fella to do?And in walks the Plugable UD-3900.While the UD-3900 wasn&rsquo;t built specifically for the Surface Pro 2, it works beautifully. Even with the incredibly snappy Amazon Prime shipping Plugable sent me an email before I got the unit with a link to the latest drivers and contact information in case I had problems. Being impatient like I am, I installed the drivers right away and anxiously awaited the package.When the UD-3900 showed up it took no time to hook it up and start using it. Everything just worked. Mostly. But I&rsquo;ll get to that later. I&rsquo;ve used USB monitors in the past, and they&rsquo;ve always disappointed me. They were always a little laggy and sluggish. I was worried the UD-3900 would suffer the same disappointment. It definitely did not. I was able to drive both of my 23&rdquo; monitors with ease. The additional USB ports were very handy and the added network speed of the UD-3900&rsquo;s Gb Ethernet jack was extra icing on the cake. I can&rsquo;t explain how easy it was to get everything working flawlessly. It just worked. With one exception&hellip;The UD-3900 was sending all its audio through the crappy, tinny little speakers on the monitor I had hooked up via HDMI. That wasn&rsquo;t quite the experience I had in mind. Even when I connected my regular speakers to the headphone jack on the UD-3900 the sound stayed on my monitor. I replied to the email Plugable initially sent me and told them my tale of woe. They replied in less than an hour, on a Saturday afternoon! They gave me a couple of things to try. When those things didn&rsquo;t pan out they immediately sent me out a replacement unit. I got the replacement unit today and it works like a champ.A few of my friends are picking up Surface Pro 2s, and I&rsquo;m recommending the UD-3900 to all of them.tk</p>

<h5 id="the-plugable-is-fantastic-i-bring-my-surface-pro-3-to-the">The Plugable is fantastic. I bring my Surface Pro 3 to the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this docking station for a new office; I use a Surface Pro 3 for most of my mobile computing but in a new workspace I wanted the luxury of a larger screen as well as the ability to use a full-size keyboard and trackball. At first I planned to install a full-size all-in-one desktop PC, but then realized I could purchase this Plugable dock, a monitor, keyboard and trackball for much less. In short: The Plugable is fantastic. I bring my Surface Pro 3 to the office, plug in the USB cable running to the Plugable, and I&rsquo;m ready to work in about 10 seconds flat. Honestly, the Plugable probably has a few features that I&rsquo;m not using - I admit that I&rsquo;ve never read the instructions beyond how to install the Plugable&rsquo;s driver. It has made my Surface Pro 3 much more enjoyable to use, to the point that I forget that I&rsquo;m theoretically using a tablet to do all of my work. Get the Plugable - you won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
