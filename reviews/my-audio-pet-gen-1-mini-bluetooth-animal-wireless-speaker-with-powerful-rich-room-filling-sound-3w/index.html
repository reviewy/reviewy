<h5 id="mind-blowing">Mind Blowing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Shut the front door!I have an array of Bluetooth speakers from cheapest to high end. I opened this expecting to hear well if I was sitting at my desk with it on my desk or in my kitchen IF dishwasher or no other noise was competing.WAS I SURPRISED!!!!!This little cutie has a rich quality sound with volume that will blow your mind! In fact, if it&rsquo;s playing in my kitchen? You can hear clearly in every adjoining room &amp; further.It also connects quickly with zero fuss. Some devices, it&rsquo;s almost as if you have to stand on one leg with arm next to device and after 10 minutes, you MAY be connected. This connected lickity split.I purchased as an extra gift to have on hand or a last minute stocking stuffer. Instead I had two teens fighting over it during my trial run!Absolutely am beyond shocked at the volume &amp; quality in this bitty cute speaker.I haven&rsquo;t tried the selfie/video features but if the sound is the bar, they&rsquo;ll be great fun.I&rsquo;ll definitely be ordering more! Great gifts &amp; you can never have too many speakers&hellip;at least that&rsquo;s what I tell my Mr. :-)</p>

<h5 id="an-actual-review-that-wasn-t-bought">An ACTUAL review that wasn&rsquo;t bought.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THE PRODUCT FULL PRICE&hellip;Just saying because I hate those discount reviews too. ANYWAYS, for $20 This little speaker, in my opinion, does a fantastic job. It can be super loud, with a bass that isn&rsquo;t the best, but still unexpectedly awesome. It comes with a charger and a little strap to loop onto whatever you&rsquo;re carrying around. I use this when walking around the park (Pokemon GO haha) And other occasions. I got the panda one. Material feels like a nice soft plastic and built to last a good while. I just got it today so if any new problems come up, I&rsquo;ll do an update!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="powerful-speaker">Powerful speaker!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow! Just got this today, and it is wonderful!! The charge is fast, and the sound is so big for a speaker that fits in the palm of my small hand. Made a great gift for me (used an Amazon gift card to get it). If you&rsquo;re looking for a portable, wireless speaker, I highly recommend it. It&rsquo;s also a snap to set up! I watched the video, and it was as easy as those kids demonstrated!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tiny-speaker-but-doesn-t-work-with-skype">Great tiny speaker, but doesn&rsquo;t work with Skype</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I never wanted a Bluetooth wireless speaker, but when I was browsing through Amazon, I noticed it and immediately put it in my cart.When they arrived, I was surprised how tiny they were - a bit smaller, then I expected. It&rsquo;s smaller than a chicken egg!The quality is great, doesn&rsquo;t look cheap (although they are, I paid only 25$), it&rsquo;s more like a cute accessory on your table and then a Bluetooth speaker. The quality of the sound is great, not-200$-Bose-great, but as good as you can expect from a 25$ speaker.I use this speaker with my Samsung Galaxy 7 Edge because it doesn&rsquo;t give me enough sound to listen to music or watch Youtube.For myself, I bought a panda and I also bought another one for my grandparents (a pug, because they do have a pug named Guppy) so they could hear movies on their laptop better.One more great feature, that was a surprise for me, that I can use the button on the bottom of the pet to activate the shutter on my phone, you just need a Bluetooth to be on. It works every time.Although I like this speaker, there are two issues I don&rsquo;t like:1. The speaker doesn&rsquo;t work wth Skype2. When I turn on/off the speaker it makes such a loud sound, that it wakes up my baby girl. I wish it was much quieter.If you&rsquo;re looking to just have fun and blast tunes in a dorm room or in a remote location on the go, or like me, want to have the louder sound of your mobile phone, then this is the best option. Although there are some issues I don&rsquo;t like, I have no regret purchasing this mini speaker for my grandparents and myself.Battery life is pretty good, I charge it once a week.</p>

<h5 id="cutest-little-thing-ever">CUTEST LITTLE THING EVER!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>To be honest I haven&rsquo;t tried it yet because it&rsquo;s a gift and I didn&rsquo;t want to take it out of the package. But it&rsquo;s unbelievably tiny and cute and I know they will love it. Plus I got the funniest letter from the owners of the business that made me laugh in this most dismal part of Christmas&hellip;called pre Christmas shopping anxiety. I know they will love this tiny animal &hellip;. I would highly advise to buy this cute little speaker!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-amazing">Absolutely amazing!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had very low expectations for this tiny speaker. At best, I thought it would give my daughter a cute novelty gift. She loves pandas. But when we got it and connected it with Bluetooth to her phone, and started playing music&hellip; I was shocked at how good the sound quality is! Even at high volume. It&rsquo;s also very loud for a tiny little thing. My daughter absolutely loves it! I can&rsquo;t say enough good things about it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small, wireless speaker. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<h5 id="check-out-my-little-friend">Check out my little friend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OMG my little pet is not only adorable it&rsquo;s loud. This blue tooth speaker is very easy to install. It also has some great features like listening to phone calls thru your speakers and selfie hookup, I haven&rsquo;t tried that yet. But if it&rsquo;s anything like the speaker sound and phone connection I can only imagine it will work just fine as well. I took it to work and my coworkers were extremely surprised at the sound and how cute my pet is they now want to order one. Thank you JAKAB for your wonderful product.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound-quality-and-value">Great sound quality and value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So cute yet such big sound! Easy to set up. Bought this after seeing it on Oprah&rsquo;s &ldquo;Favorite Thing&rsquo;s&rdquo; and then reading all the great reviews. Had it delivered to the Amazon locker at my office and immediately set it up at my desk. My co-workers and I were amazed at the sound quality. We&rsquo;ve been enjoying Christmas Carols for the past 2 weeks, thanks to &ldquo;Pandamonium Panda&rdquo;.</p>
