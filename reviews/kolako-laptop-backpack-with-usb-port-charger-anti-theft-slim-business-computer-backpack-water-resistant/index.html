<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="this-is-a-wonderful-backpack-for-school">This is a wonderful backpack for school</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a wonderful backpack for school. It&rsquo;s funky and hold a good amount of stuff! I put my laptop, textbooks, notebooks and lunch box in it and it&rsquo;s about the right size. The straps are wide and solid enough so that my shoulder is comfortable with heavy carry. There is a front pocket that can hold my basketball which is convenient. I recommend it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-the-wait">Worth the wait?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product itself is really nice. Do be aware that it is not as large as it appears in the picture and that there is not a battery pack for charging included with the pack, just the USB cords to plug your device in. It is a very well made pack and is very attractive. My teen has had a lot of compliments on it at school, as well as people asking where she got it. The shipping time was a lot longer than any other product I have ever ordered through Amazon, as it came through a regular postal service from Asia to USPS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-the-price">Great for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this one for the USB charger, but it is just extetion, this one does not have a bettry or something inside. However, you can put you power back in you backpack and still charge your phone while you hiking. I feel like the extension helped a lot for traveling . The quality of the bag is good, so far I can not tell the difference between this one to my Swiss gear, in fact this one is lighter. Have good protection for the laptop as well. Overall, really good product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buyer-beware-looks-good-quality-substandard">Buyer Beware, looks good, quality substandard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They do not stand by their product. I paid $31.99 for this bag. My nephew used it for 3 weeks and the strap started to rip. I was asked to send a photo of it and I did. The manufacturer contacted me and said they will &ldquo;allow me&rdquo; to keep a bag that I already paid for, (how nice of them) and will send me $3 or $4. Not acceptable. Since then, one of the zippers broke. This bag looks good but the quality is below standards. Do yourself a favor and keep your money.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="truly-good-quality-it-looks-great-even-comparing-it-with">Truly good quality. It looks great even comparing it with &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Truly good quality. It looks great even comparing it with my old Swiss backpack. So I would say made a good decision. Charging function is a plus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-but-not-great">Ok, but not great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like the bag but it&rsquo;s failed for me a couple of ways so far. 1. One of the strap holders broke. 2. I was out in the rain (with an umbrella) and legal pass in my bag were soaked when I went to unload it. Still a pretty good bag for the price.I/m updating this review as I really think it deserves a 4. The broken clasp was more my fault than anything inherently wrong with the backpack. Load it up with 40 pounds of stuff then grab it by its strap and something&rsquo;s going to break. I really like this backpack and if your not a gorilla (like I am) and don&rsquo;t expect it to carry a ton then you&rsquo;ll probably get years of service out of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice it fits all my kids books and is comfortable</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="zipper-frayed-and-broken-after-first-week-of-use">Zipper frayed and broken after first week of use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this to use as a school backpack during my year long masters program in England. I have only been here a week and already the zipper on the front pouch has become frayed and now fallen off. Very cool backpack and is waterproof as advertised, but due to the cheap quality there is no point in buying it if it will just be broken in a week.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-still-think-the-backpack-is-a-good-buy-it-s-roomy-and-waterproof">I still think the backpack is a good buy, It&rsquo;s roomy and waterproof</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although the name appearing on the Logo octagon is not &ldquo;KOLAKO&rdquo; and the back straps are different, in all other respects, it&rsquo;s the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="other-than-that-it-s-a-good">Other than that it’s a good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had the backpack for three weeks and the zipper is broken already(when zipping up the zipper separates). Other than that it’s a good backpack</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-this-backpack">I absolutely love this backpack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this backpack! I go to college in Florida where the weather can change at the drop of a dime. Rain resistant is a MUST!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="zipper-troubles">Zipper Troubles!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In under 2 weeks since receiving, the zipper has separated several times once zipped shut. Hoping using the other zip closure stops this from happening.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent book bag, it’s very spacious, love it!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this backpack everyday for college classes. It can carry a lot of stuff.</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately I just found out that this backpack I purchased for my nephew did not work. I was able to visit him for the first time since it was sent and asked him only to find&hellip;</p>
