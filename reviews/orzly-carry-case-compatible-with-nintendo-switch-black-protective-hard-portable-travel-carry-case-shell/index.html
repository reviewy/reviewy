<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="the-newer-batch-from-late-april-is-great-quality">The newer batch from late April is great quality.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The materials for this case are simply poor quality, I feel like I can snap it in half if I bend it slightly. I bought a cheaper hard case from a different brand that felt much better but didn&rsquo;t have room for the switch controllers to remain attached, but I&rsquo;m going back to it because I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable with the durability of this case. For example, the zipper is so poorly attached I see the thread already unraveling that attaches it to the case and I just got it. When you do zip it, it feels very uneven and unsturdy. I&rsquo;m genuinely surprised at the poor quality.UPDATE: 5/1/17-After my poor review, Nina from Orzly reached out to me and asked me to describe the issues I had with the case - she quickly determined that the quality did not meet their standards and sent me a replacement from England (I&rsquo;m in NYC US) - I just received the new case and its far better quality, no more string sticking out, the zippers are on straight and the two sides are perfectly symmetrical - feels like a completely different product. Maybe they had a bad batch, but this current case is great and I would now highly recommend it - not to mention this appears to be a company that stands behind their products. Thanks Nina and Orzly.</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-service-and-quality">Wonderful Service and Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wonderful service and quality. When I first opened my package, a pamphlet of other Orzly accessories, the case, and a personal note were located in my package. The note was written to inform me about a pricing issue that they encountered in the office, accidentally changing my price to half of the original&rsquo;s worth. Despite this issue, they decided to keep the change, and ask me to write an informative review of the product.The case looks and feels sturdy, the sides are firm, and the top and bottom are softer. Inside, it has plenty of space for all the extra accessories you may need, such as a stand, extra joy cons, a charger, etc. Although where the Switch goes is not completely close fitting, the extra space allows you to place your item underneath the elastic bands, which safely holds your electronic for safe keeping. Finally, the game slots tightly keep all of the cards for safe keeping, so you can have your whole library wherever you go, and never be worried about them being damaged.Overall, the great service and high quality product was well worth the money and shipping time, and I will be sure to come back to this company again.</p>

<h5 id="but-it-s-nice-that-it-has-an-area-to-store-game-cards">but it&rsquo;s nice that it has an area to store game cards &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This carrying case is exactly what I wanted for my switch. It&rsquo;s firm which means I don&rsquo;t have to worry about the screen or body of the switch getting damaged in my bag when I&rsquo;m traveling. I don&rsquo;t have physical games for my switch, but it&rsquo;s nice that it has an area to store game cards if you have them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-case">Great case!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case appears to be pretty well built for the Switch. I ordered a black one, sadly I was sent a blue one. Rather then deal with the hassle of returns I will keep it. <em>Update</em> I&rsquo;ve upgraded the review star rating to five stars, as the vendor has corrected a color mix up. Thanks Orzly!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-exactly-how-it-was-described">Great quality, exactly how it was described</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality, exactly how it was described. It&rsquo;s a Christmas present for my son that obviously goes with the Nintendo Switch. Wanted to make sure there were no excuses on taking great care of it. Another BIG bonus is this company started off my Christmas cheer. There was a typo in the sale price and instead of 19.98 it was listed as 9.98. They honored the price and Free shipping from UK. This just made my day. With everything going on in the world its such a pleasant reminder that we are all alike and just need to give a little love just because. Even if its just honoring a mistake. Thanks again so much and will be looking to purchase from ORZLY again in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-for-the-money">Good for the money &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty good case, I&rsquo;ve been using mine since April for travel with my Nintendo Switch, mostly via airliner. It has a lot of storage on the inside for games. One thing I do not like is the straps on the inside for securing the Switch. One broke fairly quickly after using it, but some tape fixed it. Not a bad deal at all for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="switch-fits-great-i-wish-the-top-shell-had-a-little">Switch fits great. I wish the top shell had a little &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Switch fits great. I wish the top shell had a little more room. I feel like its pressing on the switch if I stuff a power plug in there, even ones smaller than the AC adapter that comes with it. But for what it is, its put together well and seems great!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ultimate-switch-gear">Ultimate Switch Gear</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great accessories for the Nintendo Switch - I researched the heck out of the huge possible Amazon selections, then bought their carry case, screen protector and the Joy-Con covers for my just received Switch.Quality packaging and product - you can tell these guys are in it for the long haul. Check out their video installation instructions for the screensaver - it&rsquo;s a great idea how to put it on perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-like-it-is-well-made">Looks like it is well made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks like it is well made. However, it has a strong toxic scent to it. Gross. No way I can give this to my teenage daughter for Christmas.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This article will be a gift, the box is unopened so I have no opinion of it. Sorry.</p>

<h5 id="it-s-pretty-rad">It&rsquo;s pretty rad</h5>

<p>Despite the technical error Orzly hade made (they made a typo on the price which was $9.81 instead of $19.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: Has a handle, holds my extra Joycons, holds my Nyko portable dock, and holds the switch.Cons: Because it can&rsquo;t do everything, I still have the case I replaced by&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This arrived very quickly!!!! Just what I wanted!!Thank you!!!</p>

<h5 id="nice-item">Nice item!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice item &ndash; exactly as promised!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-case">Good case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this case for $9.81 instead of the usual price due to a typo. I was also surprised when I got a free USB Type-C Cable included in the mail.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-case-awesome-company">Awesome case, Awesome company!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a solid case for the switch. The outside cover is soft, but durable, and is adequate to protect the Switch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well">Works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great. Carries everything we needed to carry and I&rsquo;m not as concerned about my son breaking my $300 investment</p>
