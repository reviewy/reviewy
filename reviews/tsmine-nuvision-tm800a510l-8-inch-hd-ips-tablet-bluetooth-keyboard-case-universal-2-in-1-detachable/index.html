<h5 id="can-t-use-camera-beware-of-scratching-screen">Can&rsquo;t use camera. Beware of scratching screen.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Item works but has issues. Upper right holder interferes with the front facing camera and there is no opening in the case for the rear facing camera. There is also no protection for the tablet screen when closed with the keyboard attached. Keyboard has to be removed or turned around to prevent screen scratches.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case and keyboard is perfect for the Nuvision TM800A510L 8&rdquo; HD IPS Tablet. Bluetooth paired quickly and easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="surprisingly-well-made-and-high-quality">Surprisingly well made and high quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is actually a very well made, stylish, and useful case. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect for it being so cheap but I am extremely happy. Its been bouncing around in my backpack and knocked around by my toddler and dogs and it looks new.When using it to fold over to read I don&rsquo;t like the feel of the keys on the back so I just detach the keyboard (it has 4 magnets holding it in place) and I put it between the covers. it stays put and it is a nicer feel in my opinion.There is also a magnet to hold the latch in place when the cover is open. That&rsquo;s a nice touch.I&rsquo;ve very happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-trick-i-really-like-it">Does the trick, I really like it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this for my NuVision 8-inch tablet, as I saw people were buying this for that. So far, I have no issues with it. I typed up a report yesterday, and have used it to type up quite a few emails, all went well.I will say that I experienced a few of the things other have mentioned with the keyboard, including the skipping of letters while typing, typing delay, and a single key getting stuck. What I noticed is that it only does this when another Blue Tooth device is connected and in use. I also purchased a mouse to use, and when that was activated I had the above things happen. Once I turned the mouse off, then the problem was solved. I knocked it down a star just for that.The case itself is sturdy and seems pretty well made. The keyboard is magnetic, which is nice. The straps were a little tight when I tried to secure the tablet, and I thought I was going to break the plastic hooks. But everything snapped in to place and secured fine. The battery life for the keyboard seems to be pretty good. I have only charged it once, and it is still going strong after 3 days now.For the price, its not bad, but I wouldnt spend more than the $25 I paid on this thing.,</p>

<h5 id="no-camera-hole-and-keyboard-won-t-pair-with-tablet">No camera hole, and keyboard won&rsquo;t pair with tablet &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No camera hole, and keyboard won&rsquo;t pair with tablet, it paired right away with my pc. A box appears with the tablet, asks for passcode, what passcode? Can&rsquo;t enter something that doesn&rsquo;t exist. Since it paired with computer problem must lie with tablet. I don&rsquo;t know, but it&rsquo;s frustrating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="absolutely-horrible-updated">Absolutely Horrible. (UPDATED)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just got this thing today and one of the plastic latches already snapped off while trying to place the tablet (8-inch NuVision) inside this cover case.Aside from that, the keyboard itself feels awful. I understand that it is an 8-inch keyboard and I shouldn&rsquo;t expect much, but for 25 dollars I think I&rsquo;m allowed to expect a little more; let alone the fact that it JUST BROKE on me.This really sucks, because there aren&rsquo;t any official cases for this tablet. I bought this case in order to have somewhere to keep the tablet safe. Looks like I&rsquo;ll have to get a refund. Definitely not buying another one.EDIT: I&rsquo;m updating this review in order to be fair about things. I originally gave it a 1-Star review (because of all the things mentioned above). I am now going to leave this at a solid 3 Stars simply because, despite missing a latch, I am still able too keep my tablet in this case using the remaining three latches.Aside from the latch issue, the case feels nice and covers the tablet well.The keyboard, although still quite awful, is at least useful when I need to type something up and don&rsquo;t feel like removing the tablet from the case (the latches are still very, very tight and are hard to work with). I will admit that it turns on and connects to my Windows 10 tablet very fast. Almost instantaneously. Once you pair it to the Bluetooth once you won&rsquo;t have to do it again, which is great.</p>

<h5 id="keyboard-is-unusable">Keyboard is unusable.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case is fine, but the keyboard is unusable. It pairs just fine with my tablet, but frequently does one of these three things:1. Ignores key presses for long periods of time, and then catches up slowly and sporadically.2. Misses many keys in the middle of a string being typed.3. Acts as if it has a stuck key and continually spews the same character.UPDATE: 4 months after posting my initial review, the seller contacted me and offered to ship me a replacement, which they promptly did. The replacement keyboard works just as poorly as the original. I&rsquo;ve tried both keyboards with 2 different PC&rsquo;s using 2 different operating systems. I&rsquo;ve also noticed several other reviewers complaining of the exact same issues. My conclusion: The keyboard is crap. Three stars for customer service, and one star for a terrible product.2nd UPDATE: A few days later, another replacement arrived. Not sure if the seller&rsquo;s left hand knows what the right hand is doing, but &ldquo;A&rdquo; for effort. The 3rd keyboard doesn&rsquo;t work either. Total waste of money.</p>

<h5 id="tsmine-provides-a-5-star-quality-case">Tsmine Provides a 5 Star Quality Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excited, the Tsmine NuVision tablet case with bluetooth keyboard arrived today. Really impressed with the look and feel of it. The stand is very sturdy. The image shown gives the illusion that the keyboard is one that snaps in and sits high. This isn&rsquo;t the case! The keyboard is set-in the case, keys are easy to use, and feels like a real keyboard. The four corners holding the tablet in place are somewhat difficult to stretch around the corners. I would suggest snapping in the right and the left bottom corners first, then snap in place the right/left top corners. Holds the tablet securely!</p>
