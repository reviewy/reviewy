<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="very-satisfied">Very Satisfied</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fast delivery , great product and a great price. I am so happy that I am not trying to use my cell phone as a GPS anymore. One of the great features I did not know about surprised me yesterday. The Garmin started beeping. When I looked at the Nuvi I realized there was an upcoming school zone and I was being alerted. Great Feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="garmon-6-inch-is-big-hit">Garmon 6 inch is big hit.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing negative at all! I had one that was about 5 years old and there were 4 or 5 things that I wished they would improve upon and it&rsquo;s like Garman read my mind. Everything is perfect with this one. I especially like the larger screen, school zone warnings, easy labeling sites, and split screen at exits.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="upgraded-my-garmin">Upgraded my Garmin</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Garmin navigator in my car for years, but decided to upgrade to new Garmin technology since the 65LM (reconditioned) with its 6&rdquo; screen was less than one hundred dollars. The unit arrived in perfect condition with all cables. My old 4&rdquo; screen was useless, the new 6&rdquo; screen is much better, the voice is better, satellite acquision is faster. I especially like having the arrival time in the lower right hand corner (this can be changed). Also nice is hitting the upper left corner allows the complete route to the destination to be shown. The 65LM fit on my old Garmin beanbag mount.One annoyance that still exists is if skip a turn, you get an nearly endless series of spoken messages to take the next turn, however, at least the annoying &ldquo;recalculating&rdquo; is largely gone. I wish there was a mute function to stop this, but alas the only way I see to do it is hit the power button to put the unit asleep. However, the endless &ldquo;recalculating&rdquo;I&rsquo;ve been playing with options. I started with restaurants, gas stations, etc displayed on screen all the time, but soon found the screen was so cluttered (at least near a city) that I couldn&rsquo;t see the route, so I turned this off. I experimented with &lsquo;North UP&rsquo;, but found on a quick glance I could not tell which way the car was pointing because the on screen car symbol is too symmetrical, so I am back to Track Up.One continuing annoyance is that Recently found list fills up too easily with junk addresses. I gather from the online manual there is a way to delete an individual entry, but it is not intuitive, and I haven&rsquo;t yet been able to do this. There&rsquo;s lots of spare memory, so downloaded the online manual (.pdf) onto the LM65. Unfortunately .pdf files are not supported, and I don&rsquo;t see anyway to access the manual.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-(update) For a long time I used the &lsquo;Recently found&rsquo; list for my addresses, but this list has gradually filled up with junk, so I put a lot of time into trying to delete individually entries. By fooling around I was able to delete one or two, but I couldn&rsquo;t delete a lot of them and in doing this I inadvertently added new addresses making the problem worse. .I&rsquo;ve now given up trying to use the &lsquo;Recently found&rsquo; list, but I have a work around. Pull your address from the &lsquo;Saved&rsquo; list.The advantage of the &lsquo;Saved&rsquo; list over the &lsquo;Recently found&rsquo; list is that it will have far less junk, because it will only have address that you (not Garmin) have specifically saved. To populate my Saved list, which was empty, I called up the addresses in &lsquo;Recently found&rsquo; that I wanted to keep and individually Saved them. (&ldquo;i&rdquo; leads to Save button.) I then deleted all the entries in the &lsquo;Recently found&rsquo; list. New addresses will automatically be entered by Garmin into the &lsquo;Recently found&rsquo; list, so periodically those I want to keep I can easily move into my &lsquo;Saved&rsquo; list.</p>

<h5 id="just-like-new-and-works-great">Just Like New and Works Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Even though it was a refurbished unit, it was like new. No scratches or blemishes, and packaged well. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the &ldquo;Refurbished Unit&rdquo; printed all over the outside of the box, you would have thought it was new. I updated the maps and the software using the Garmin Express app on my PC, and it works just fine. The maps it came with were about 2 years out of date, but usable. It was the &ldquo;LM&rdquo; version, so loading new maps was free. Replaced a smaller and older unit that did not have free maps ($49.99 to update), so it cost me only $21 more to upgrade to a newer, larger screen unit with lifetime free maps. What a deal!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-enough-for-a-9-yr-old-to-use">Easy enough for a 9 yr old to use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a good smart phone, or are traveling in areas of spotty service - or have poor service in general, having a dedicated GPS Navigator is really, really nice. I&rsquo;ve owned many from Garmin and competitors, and this one is a great value given the price. Works well, battery lasts a long time and the directions are clear and easy to follow. Easy to enter destinations or finding your way with the touchscreen, easy to read in the sunlight. So easy my 9 year old nephew was able to become an &ldquo;expert&rdquo; without reading so much as one page of the instructions!</p>

<h5 id="this-refurbished-garmin-nüvi-65lm-gps-navigators-system-with-spoken-turn-by-turn-directions-is-exactly-what-i-needed">This refurbished Garmin nüvi 65LM GPS Navigators System with Spoken Turn-By-Turn Directions is exactly what I needed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>How in the world I got anywhere out of town without one of these is a mystery. This refurbished Garmin nüvi 65LM GPS Navigators System with Spoken Turn-By-Turn Directions is exactly what I needed. I mounted mine so it&rsquo;s visible just above the steering wheel. All it takes is a few minutes going through the menu to set it up for out-of-town trips. I can then save the trips for later. The 6&rdquo; screen is easy to see and the spoken directions easy to follow. I especially like how when approaching major interstate exchanges it switches to split screen with a very realistic view of what I&rsquo;ll be seeing ahead before changing lanes and highways.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-unit-well-worth-the-price">Nice unit, well worth the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice unit, refurbished, but worth the money. Especially with lifetime maps. Easy to use and (as always) customer service at Garmin is superb. I called because I did not know how to load custom routes, within a few minutes the customer service person I chatted with on line explained how to load the custom routes and get the unit to recognize. No problems with the unit at all. Garmin Express software instantly recognized the unit, suggested an update (which included the maps) and within an hour the unit was set and ready to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="just-buy-it-already">JUST buy it already&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what you need to get into the GPS business. Comes with suction cup mount, automotive charger, usb cable and of course the GPS unit&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.Works like new. One Con though. Updates take an unbelievable amount of time to do. About 8 hours for me. Of course that time will change depending on your computer and Internet situation. I have a monster of a computer but my wireless network isn&rsquo;t the best so it slows ya down. This doesn&rsquo;t affect how it functions but don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to quickly update it an hour before you leave for a trip. Just buy it already.</p>
