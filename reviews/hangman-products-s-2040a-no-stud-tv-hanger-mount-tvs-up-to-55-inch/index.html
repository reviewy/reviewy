<h5 id="perfect-tv-mount-for-fast-easy-and-hassle-free-installation-i-wish-i-d-boght-this-one-first">Perfect TV mount for fast, easy and hassle-free installation. I wish I&rsquo;d boght this one first!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really do like this product. The pros: You don&rsquo;t need to find a stud to install the mount. Because of this you can install it anywhere there is drywall. The mount is also very easy to install - it took me about 5 minutes. You don&rsquo;t need any special drill bits or tools, just a hammer and a screwdriver. I&rsquo;m very impressed with the amount of weight it is able to support for how simple the product appears to be. I bought one and mounted a 32&rdquo; TV to the wall and I&rsquo;m considering buying another to mount a 47&rdquo; as well. The only real downside (and I knew this when I bought it) is that, once installed, the TV is stationary; you cannot move it back and forth or side to side. For me, the ease of installation and the ability to install anywhere without a stud makes it worth the buy. The price isn&rsquo;t too bad either; it may be a little high considering similar, swivel mounts that do require a stud for installation, are a few dollars cheaper. Overall though, very nice product that is perfect for me!</p>

<h5 id="mounted-a-65-on-my-wall-with-these-7-months-ago">Mounted a 65&rdquo; on my wall with these 7 months ago&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that my use of these is a bit unique. I have a 65&rdquo; Toshiba TV, and I enjoy it very much. My apartment wouldn&rsquo;t allow me to drill or tap into the studs in my living room wall so I was unable to use a standard wall mount hanger for my TV. So here&rsquo;s what I did&hellip;I actually reached out to Hangman Products directly, and let me start by saying that they were very friendly to communicate with. Since these are meant for 55&rdquo; TVs and smaller, they do not work particularly well with anything larger than that. The reason for this is that TVs larger than 55&rdquo; typically have the inputs and outputs facing outward from the back of the TV rather than downward. So for these, the cable clearance was a concern, but also the weight. Each of these is rated to hold 80 lbs. My TV is approximately 75 pounds or so. This is pushing the limit a bit, and made me a bit uncomfortable. But what about using two of them on the same TV?I can confirm that it works! Hangman Products stated the design limitations and weight concerns above when I spoke with them, but in theory, if the hangers could be spaced apart well enough that each was holding equal, or close to equal load, then it should have no problem holding. I risked my nice expensive TV to feed my curiosity, and the cat is still alive! I made sure to verify my measurements exactly multiple times and checked my math, and had my math checked, and mounted these into the walls with their suspiciously tiny picture nails. Trust me, when you start hammering these things in, you start getting quite concerned and thinking &ldquo;These puny things that I can bend between my fingers are going to hold up my giant TV???&rdquo;. Somehow, through science, physics, witchcraft, black magic, or some previously undisclosed alien technology, they do so just fine. Mine has been hanging on the wall since December, 2016, and it hasn&rsquo;t budged even slightly.To solve the cord problem, which is a real issue, I ran my HDMI cables into right angle adapters and filled up every input on the TV. Then I ran those cables into a project box that I built and used HDMI, TOSLINK, and other wall plates, and mounted it underneath the TV. So if I ever need to switch inputs, it&rsquo;s right there under the TV, which has turned out to be easier than it was when the TV was sitting on the top of the entertainment center.OVERALL: Great product. Ingenius. I&rsquo;m a believer, they work. It&rsquo;s a tough breath to take before you let your hard earned money rest on these seemingly puny things, but breathe easy, these won&rsquo;t let you down&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="it-hangs-man">It hangs man!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wish I had found this sooner!!! After patching holes from other mounts that had issues, including the last one that only said in fine print deep in the instructions not to mount it to a metal stud, I decided to give this one a last try. It took less than 10 minutes and looks great! The only reason for the last start not being given is that you have to screw in a black nail to a black cable that sticks out lower than the tv. I will be changing this by purchasing a cable clamp to make a loop behind the tv, and also using a weight-rated Command hook upside down so no holes in the wall! I will be purchasing more of these and letting people know about it.</p>

<h5 id="so-easy-to-install-and-works-great">So Easy to Install and Works Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product is great when you want to have the ability o mount a TV anywhere in your home. We weren&rsquo;t very confident as to where the studs were in our apartment, but it didn&rsquo;t even matter when using this product.It includes all the necessary bolts for different TV models plus a handy level to make sure the TV is mounted evenly. The wall portion of the mount uses 10 picture nails with a cushion on the back, so there won&rsquo;t be any damage to the wall when it&rsquo;s time to move.I cannot say enough good things about this TV mounting solution.</p>

<h5 id="these-mounts-can-take-some-serious-weight-been-6-months-and-it-s-still-holding-fine">These mounts can take some serious weight. Been 6+ months and it&rsquo;s still holding fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is seriously the most simple answer to a very common problem. I used two of these to hang one 32&rdquo; and a HEAVY 42&rdquo; TV on my apartment&rsquo;s drywall. They&rsquo;ve held for over 6 months by now with absolutely no issues. Installation probably took about 5 minutes.. Highly recommend.</p>

<h5 id="why-haven-t-i-heard-about-this-mount-before">Why haven&rsquo;t I heard about this mount before ??</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>​I have always mounted my televisions and have now gone through a few different models. My biggest problem has been that the studs needed to mount a TV isn&rsquo;t always in the center of the wall or where the center is where you want it. This gives you the option of mounting the TV where you want and NOT having to find a stud is such a plus.I will say I was a bit hesitant at first and admittedly still check it every so often to make sure the TV is secure. So far so good&hellip; Attaching the mount to the TV was super simple and finding the best place to mount the wall bracket took no time at all. It may be my OCD but had to try several times to get the wall bracket mounted perfectly level. After a few tries and ruining a nail or two, luckily they included several extras, I go the wall bracket perfectly level and mounting it was a breeze. However, I couldn&rsquo;t just swing my TV forward enough to mount the security cable. Found it was easier to mark the screw point and pre-drill the hole.</p>
