<blockquote>
<p>This control really makes a complete OCF system. Paired up with the YN-560III this thing rocks. Now pay attention this is made for the YN-560iii and will do what it&rsquo;s intended to do with this model flash only. When I say intended I mean it will allow you to adjust the power setting, zoom flash, set groups and channels from this control unit itself. I will re emphasize the YN560-TX + YN-560III = Success. Now it will still trigger the RF-603&rsquo;s and RF-602&rsquo;s but does not allow any kind of control from the YN560-TX unit itself. So don&rsquo;t be upset when you get it home and it won&rsquo;t allow you full control over your RF-603&rsquo;s and RF-602&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s important to know what you are buying before you order. I am rating this product based on what it&rsquo;s intended to do not what I want or wish it to do. I&rsquo;m happy to say it does it very well. Not that I had a problem before walking over to my units individually and adjusting them one at a time or God forbid I had one of my flashes all closed up in one of my soft boxes having to open it up adjust the power only to find i was still off, you get the point. It could become a little cumbersome and a bit of extra work that&rsquo;s taking up extra time you could be using to focus on more important things ( like getting the shots you need ). However this Unit alleviates any need for this, and makes using my flashes enjoyable again. Not to mention it gives you a more professional look separating you from the pack. Not just in the Wow factor but more so on the fact that it gives off the impression you have control of whats going on which you do and always did. But from a clients perspective having to run around adjusting individual flashes all the time doesn&rsquo;t come off to them as such. I am very pleased with this product. I always love anything that makes my job easier and gives me more time to focus on my creative vision. Producing in the end a better all around product I can deliver to my clients. The YN560-TX really delivers and if you are just getting introduced to Yongnuo you are in for a real treat.One last thing as far as pairing this unit up with your flashes it can be a little confusing so I will break it down for you in a few easy steps. 1: Turn both the TX control unit and flash units on.2: on the TX control unit hold down the zoom/ch and Hz/Fn at the same time. The screen will display A C T or something to that nature and the flash unit will have a blue light.3: on the flash unit press the OK button located in between the up, down, left, right buttons making sure the light remains blue. Hold down the GRP and CH button at the same time( that&rsquo;s the 2nd and third button on top). Your group icon will start flashing on the LCD screen of the flash unit. Designate the desired group to that flash by pressing the up or down button on the flash and accept by pressing the OK button in the center of the up, down, left, right, buttons. (Step 3 deals only with the flash unit and not the TX control unit).That&rsquo;s it. It should now be paired.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a real estate and architectural photographer and use my YN560-TX, as well as up to six YN560 III/IV&rsquo;s, multiple times per week. I purchased one as soon as they were available, as I knew it would be a game-changer for my line of work. Well, I was right! This thing has saved me an INCREDIBLE amount of time.Some shots have one flash behind me, one in a room to the left, to the right, up the stairs and in the far kitchen. Before, if any of the flashes were off, I&rsquo;d have to walk to each one and change it by hand. Not anymore! I bought a second one of these as a backup just because of how incredibly functional it is. If you&rsquo;re having trouble pairing your YN560 IVs with the TX, I have a review/setup on Youtube you can find entitled, &ldquo;Yongnuo YN560-TX Flash Remote Control Transmitter Setup Tutorial / Early Review &ldquo;.The photo included has two YN560-IVs and a YN560-TX. One flash behind me and one out the window to the right. Before the TX, I would have had to walk outside multiple times if the power was off.</p>

<h5 id="best-thing-since-sliced-bread">Best Thing Since Sliced Bread!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I literally ran home when I saw this thing was finally delivered to the house! I currently have 2 Yongnuo 560III flashes and was frustrated every time I needed to change the power or zoom on them because I had to either pull down the light stand or open the softbox to do so. But when I saw that the YN560 TX had come out I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get this thing on my camera and try it out.So far I haven&rsquo;t really done a through run of the thing but from my early setup and testing it works flawlessly. I saw some other folks post some videos of how to connect it to your flashes which made it easy as can be. Simple turn on the flashes and the YN560 TX, put them on the same channel, put the flashes on the &ldquo;- -&rdquo; setting, push the 2 buttons on the TX, press the &ldquo;ok&rdquo; button the flashes and your good to go. Obviously there’s a few more steps but it was pretty much that easy.Now that I have the means to adjust my flash power and zoom without going back and forth between stand and camera, I can definitely start doing some more serious lighting with my 560 III. I plan on getting a couple more 560 III to go along with this thing so I can really use them on the go versus lugging those big old&rsquo; strobes. Now if you do have some strobes/monolights, you can obviously only trigger them with this, so don&rsquo;t buy it expecting to control your lights power from this, but an actually commander. This only controls the power and zoom of the 560 III so far, maybe it will work with the new Yongnuo&rsquo;s equivalent to the Canon 600 down the line.Overall, rock solid product that I highly recommend because of the cost, convenience and so far, the performance. I don&rsquo;t think you can get this anywhere else, where you can by a trigger plus a couple lights and only end up spending under 2 to 3 hundred bucks.Great Job Yongnuo&hellip;keep the great affordable products coming!!!</p>

<h5 id="everything-they-re-cracked-up-to-be">Everything they&rsquo;re cracked up to be</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With this, I also bought a pair of Yongnuo YN560 IV wireless speedlites, the most updated version as of this writing. Yongnuo should have produced their own How-To video by now to explain these, which is their only drawback. Printed instructions are horrible, translated from Chinese, I assume.They&rsquo;re rated right alongside the Canon products that cost at least twice as much, and are every bit as good.My only regret is that there is a cheaper kit with this YN560-TX and two YN560 III speedlites as a package. The only difference between the version III and version IV is the IV&rsquo;s ability to transmit a signal (as does the YN560-TX). Shoulda bought the cheaper version III&rsquo;s.</p>
