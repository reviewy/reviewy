And Yamaha fills stadiums and concert halls with beautifully amplified sound to raise audiences to their feet. That means that Yamaha uses its knowledge of all aspects of audio design to bring the music to life in your home with the best in home theater and audio.</p>

<p>Full support of the latest technologies ensure maximum enjoyment of all high-definition sources. View back panel
Yamaha&rsquo;s RX-V867 Home Theater Receiver offers full support for the latest HDMI features and HD audio formats to ensure maximum enjoyment of all high-definition sources. Other exciting features include HDMI video upconversion and deinterlacing, iPod and Bluetooth audio compatibility, YPAO sound optimization, Adaptive Dynamic Range Control, and four SCENE buttons.</p>

<p>The Latest HDMI Features and High-Definiton Audio Decoders for a Cinematic Experience
With seven channels and 665 watts of powerful surround sound (95W x 7 RMS), you can immerse yourself in your favorite movies and music. The latest HD Audio format decoding such as Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio, Dolby Digital Plus, and DTS-HD High Resolution Audio render soundtracks in lifelike detail. The latest HDMI support offers Deep Color (<sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub> bit), x.v.Color, 24Hz refresh rate capability, and Auto Lip-Sync compensation, as well as the newest HDMI features like 3D and Audio Return Channel.</p>

<p>The RX-V867 features 6 1080p-compatible HDMI inputs and 2 HDMI outputs (simultaneous), giving it the room and power to spare for all your high-definition home entertainment gear.</p>

<p>Pure Direct Mode for High Definition Sources
The RX-V867 lets you enjoy the best possible picture and immersive surround sound from Blu-ray Disc players and other high-definition sources. It supports the two lossy formats&ndash;Dolby Digital Plus and DTS HD High Resolution&ndash;as well as lossless formats such as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio.</p>

<p>Pure Direct is a special receiver mode that causes the signal to bypass all but the most basic audio circuitry, and even turns off the display to prevent any chance of noise interference. It provides the purest possible high-fidelity sound from all sources including HDMI inputs.</p>

<p>Independent Zone 2 Operation for Second-Room Audio
You can enjoy sound in a separate room because the RX-V867 provides Zone 2 audio output. Furthermore, Zone 2 power amplifier assignability and speaker terminals mean that Zone 2 can be fully independent with its own 2-channel power, while you still enjoy 5-channel sound in the main room.</p>

<p>Exclusive Yamaha Features for Surround Realism</p>

<p>Create rich sound fields with CINEMA DSP on the Yamaha RX-V867 receiver
Yamaha CINEMA DSP is an advanced exclusive technology for creating richly realized independent sound fields that envelop you in an unmatched surround sound experience. With dialogue, music and effects ideally located in these separate sound fields, you will hear sound with accurate placement, smooth movement, exceptional clarity and richness, and startlingly realistic presence. 17 CINEMA DSP 3D settings let you customize the effect for your room. Adaptive DSP Level evaluates the difference between the volume level and a reference level, adjusting the DSP level to ensure optimum effectiveness, so you&rsquo;ll experience cinema-quality audio even at lower volumes.</p>

<p>CINEMA DSP&rsquo;s decoding technology also takes advantage of Yamaha&rsquo;s Compressed Music Enhancer, so you can enjoy your digital music library on your home theater system without sacrificing audio quality.</p>

<p>12 SCENE choices (4 on front panel for quick setting changes and others via the full-color GUI), including 4 SCENE buttons for Zone 2. Pressing a single SCENE button automatically launches multiple operations to make your devices work together&ndash;no more fumbling with the remote control. They are initially set to default settings for DVD Viewing, Disc Listening, TV Viewing and Radio Listening, but can be customized to whatever you need.</p>

<p>Yamaha™&rsquo;s YPAO system uses a small microphone (included) and sophisticated equalization to automatically set the best sound for any room, no matter where the speakers are. First, it checks the speaker connections and phase of each speaker. Then it sends out tones which are captured by the microphone to analyze the room acoustics and sets a variety of parameters, such as the speaker size, the distance of the speakers and even the sound pressure level until it achieves the best sound conditions for your room&ndash;and you don&rsquo;t have to do anything.</p>

<p>Next-Gen Connectivity and Flexibility
In addition to great video and sound quality, the RX-V867 lets you bring music from multiple next-generation sources into your home. This SIRIUS-Ready receiver lets you access your favorite SIRIUS Satellite Radio entertainment, including 100% commercial-free music, plus sports, uncensored talk, comedy, exclusive entertainment, world-class news and more, directly through your audio system with the use of an optional SIRIUS Connect Home Tuner kit. Rhapsody support gives you access to your Rhapsody account (subscription required) to play a virtually unlimited amount of music.</p>

<p>You can even bring your own tunes to the RX-V867. DLNA compatibility delivers network features: Using a local area network (LAN) connection and Windows Media Connect, you can play MP3, WMA and WAV music from your PC or laptop, or listen to any of the thousands of stations available on Internet radio using the included MP3 vTuner data service. Yamaha Network Receivers get you connected to the vast music content available anywhere on your LAN and on the web.</p>

<p>It is also equipped to use Yamaha&rsquo;s optional YBA-10 Bluetooth Wireless Audio Receiver, giving you the flexibility to stream music from Bluetooth enabled mobile phones, portable devices and even your personal computer. The optional YDS-12 Universal iPod Dock or the wireless YID-W10 iPod Dock connects the RX-V867 to all versions of Apple&rsquo;s iPod, giving you the power to navigate and play music from your favorite Apple products via an onscreen menu.</p>

<p>Full HD 1080p Video Upscaling and Deep Color (<sup>30</sup>&frasl;<sub>36</sub>-bit) Transmission
The HDMI interface upgrades the transmission of standard, enhanced, and high-definition video signals via HDMI for higher-than-ever quality through a single cable. With four HDMI inputs and one HDMI output, you can connect a variety of high-definition sources such as Blu-ray Disc players and switch easily among them.</p>

<p>The RX-V867 supports the latest HDMI 30- and 36-bit color depths, improved from the 24-bit depth of previous versions. This &ldquo;Deep Color&rdquo; allows the rendering of billions of colors for far greater accuracy. Colors are so vivid they seem to jump off the screen, with perfectly smooth tonal transitions and ultra-fine gradations between colors. It also enables many times more shades of gray, for higher contrast ratio.</p>

<p>Analog Video to HDMI Digital Video Upconversion
This is a function that converts analog signals from composite, or component terminals to output from higher quality HDMI digital video. This ensures the highest possible picture quality from the AV receiver to a monitor or TV via a single cable.</p>

<p>Auto Lip-Sync Compensation Keeps Your Experience On Track
When video and audio signals are transferred via HDMI and the video is shown on a display and the audio output is performed by an A/V receiver, the video delay time (time from signal input until it is seen) and the audio delay time (time from signal input until it is heard) are different. This can result in the video and audio slipping out of sync. The Auto Lip-Sync compensation function monitors the video delay time, and automatically adjusts the amount of audio delay to eliminate the difference, so you always hear the dialogue just as the person is speaking.</p>

<p>Digital ToP-ART Philosophy Brings You Superior Receiver Stability
Digital ToP-ART (Total Purity Audio Reproduction Technology) is the name Yamaha has given to a design philosophy whose goal is to maximize digital quality while minimizing analog circuitry. The culmination of Yamaha&rsquo;s long experience in digital engineering and design, it brings together several key elements to create the best-sounding A/V components available on the market. This includes high-grade Burr-Brown DAC units as well as other high quality audio-grade parts. The RX-V867 also has an all-channel discrete amplifier configuration.</p>

<p>On-Screen Display Makes Navigation Easy
An on-screen display makes operating the RX-V867 easy and intuitive. Access and control everything you need from a simple and easy-to-navigate interface.</p>

<h5 id="family-friendly-design-with-sound-enhancing-features">Family-friendly design with sound-enhancing features</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I searched the Internet thoroughly before buying my first receiver in about a decade. I have been an audiophile since the 70&rsquo;s and used to use tube electronics and other exotica, but I was out of date regarding practical family-friendly AV receivers. I was put-off by the emphasis that some manufacturer&rsquo;s place in iPod/iPhone compatibility &ndash; that feature is a nice-to-have in my book but it doesn&rsquo;t address the core requirements of a good home theater system. In the end, I selected Yamaha due to consistently good reviews for performance, reliability, and customer service; good reviews for sound quality in the British press; Internet software upgrade capability; CinemaDSP and similar features; and positive previous experience with the brand (although with musical instruments rather than electronic equipment).I hope that my review will touch on topics of interest that are not well-covered in Internet reviews such as late-night listening, two-speaker systems, and the operation of CinemaDSP and other DSP functions.So far I am very satisfied with the product. I hooked it up and got it going without consulting the Easy Start guide or the owners&rsquo; manual (provided on a CD). The menus are intuitive for nearly anyone who has worked with other AV equipment in recent years, and it has defaults set for parameters that one either doesn&rsquo;t understand or doesn&rsquo;t care about. In fact, I only needed to consult the owner&rsquo;s manual for two issues: Updating the firmware (which worked flawlessly) and operating the network features.Unlike most users (apparently), my living room isn&rsquo;t well-suited for surround sound. So, I run my system with two high-end speakers and a subwoofer. Therefore, I was very interested in what CinemaDSP could do to make the two-speaker system into a credible home theater system. To my surprise and delight, it actually works very well: Dialog is well-centered and the background effects seem widely spread beyond the edges of the speakers. Although it isn&rsquo;t a substitute for real surround, it is much better than my previous receiver which created a traditional 2-channel stereo sound field. The CinemaDSP effect is somewhat retained off-axis as well, so it isn&rsquo;t necessary to sit precisely in the center &ldquo;sweet spot.&ldquo;I have the two speakers wired up in the receiver&rsquo;s bi-amp mode. (Note that this isn&rsquo;t a true bi-amp mode; it only works with loudspeakers that have a built-in crossover designed to function in this manner.) The music reproduction is vastly improved compared to my previous Pioneer receiver and is somewhat &ldquo;high-end&rdquo; in character with outstanding clarity and a treble that is very clean rather than harsh. Since this model has pre-out jacks, one could use a true external audiophile-quality power amplifier for the main speakers (and any other channel) if desired.The YPAO automatic calibration system couldn&rsquo;t be easier to use. I mounted the supplied microphone to a camera tripod, plugged the cable into the receiver, turned it on, and the receiver knew what I wanted to do and guided me step-by-step through the process. I had it do measurements at three different listening positions and setup the calibration automatically; the whole process took 20 minutes (including the time it took to find the tripod in the basement). Although the receiver provides the option for manually tweaking the equalization, it claimed to have achieved a flat frequency response so I see no reason to change it. The sound quality was significantly better, with improved midrange clarity and smoother bass performance. Maybe the Audyssey system of other receiver brands is more sophisticated, but the YPAO seemed to do the trick of taming the resonances of my highly reflective listening room.The networking functionality was very easy to get up and running. Configuring it for my household LAN was performed fully automatically. By setting Windows Media Player to &ldquo;streaming&rdquo; capability on my Windows 7 machine, I was able to access my complete music collection using the receiver. The user interface is easy to understand, and it displays cover art on the TV screen as well as correctly displaying English and foreign alphabets. It seems to be able to play the variety of file formats that my collection is in (AAC, MP3, WMP). The Internet Radio feature allows users to search the world for radio stations and easily play them; the sound &ldquo;Enhancer&rdquo; significantly upgrades the sound quality from these sources.My lifestyle usually dictates that TV-watching or what-have-you begins rarely earlier than 9pm on most evenings. And that means that sleeping children and neighbors are not far away. So my primary concern is with high quality sound at low-to-moderate levels rather than the full-impact of THX reference-level theater sound, which I can only rarely use. Practically, I was looking for dynamic range compression that enables the dialog to be heard reliably, without constantly changing the volume levels using the remote throughout the show. The Yamaha has two methods of controlling dynamic range, and I have been using both. They seem to do a good job of keeping dialog audible at lower listening levels and preventing the commercial &ldquo;blast away&rdquo; problem, but without adding audible side-effects. I don&rsquo;t know how it compares to Audyssey&rsquo;s Dynamic Volume, but it does work and is very easy to adjust as desired. Also, it reduces the quantity of low bass when listening at low levels (kind of the opposite effect of a &ldquo;loudness&rdquo; button), which reduces annoyance to others trying to sleep.The application of CinemaDSP to headphones is fascinating - it changes the character of the sound from being &ldquo;inside your head&rdquo; to a more natural sound field. It doesn&rsquo;t give you true surround sound when wearing headphones of course, but it does give you a more convincing experience than regular 2-channel audio. I like it a lot - it really improves the headphone listening experience. Note that when you plug headphones into the receiver, it automatically configures CinemaDSP for headphone use.Other random thoughts: The thin remote is elegant and easy enough to use (although it doesn&rsquo;t fully replace the functionality of my other remotes, which is par for the course); the HDMI and video digital conversion features are working without a hitch; and the receiver runs cool when running at normal volume levels, although it is installed in a cabinet. Overall, this receiver is a very well-integrated design that is sophisticated underneath but easy to approach for users. If you just want to do basic functions, then they are easy to do. If you want to geek-out with tweaking, you can do that as well.</p>

<h5 id="yamaha-rx-v867-receiver-is-excellent">Yamaha RX-V867 receiver is excellent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I upgraded to the Yamaha RX-V867 primarily to get internet radio. I enjoy listening to high quality classical music and the internet has an abundance of stations available. An unexpected benefit - the sound quality is noticeably better than the replaced 4 year old receiver (not Yamaha) with a similar price point.Basic setup was straight forward with no problems. The internet connection and access to music files on my PC did not require any special setup and functioned without problem. The only condition for the PC access is that the Windows Media Player be set to allow sharing - I believe mine was by default.On the negative side, I add to many other complaints relative to Yamaha receivers about the lack of a printed manual for products in this price range. I printed a copy of the manual from the CD for convenient access.The abundance of features and setting options has a down side. For a technical person like myself, it took a lot of study to understand all the settings and features available. I suspect that a non-technical person might find it difficult to get beyond the basic setup and use all the available features. However, Yamaha did an excellent job wth the GUI, making it easy to navigate the settings once the user becomes familiar with the structure. Personally, I want the many features, and the learning curve is the necessary price to pay.I did a test of the presence speaker feature using a temporary setup with some good bookshelf speakers propped into position (step ladder etc). My test was on music using a high quality CD for the source. The presence speakers did provide a noticeable improvement in the sound experience (compared to my 5.1 setup), but not a &ldquo;wow&rdquo; improvement. This setup is in a small room (converted bedroom). I am undecided about adding permanent presence speakers.</p>
