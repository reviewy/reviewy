<h5 id="great-little-action-camera-with-good-functionality">Great little action camera with good functionality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this item at a discount from the manufacturer after trying out one of their other cameras, the PPLEE 1080P Wifi, and not being as satisfied with the picture quality. This camera is MUCH better. I am new to action cameras and purchased one for an upcoming trip to central America. I did not want to buy a GoPro given the high price point and my tendancy to lose things.This camera is great, it takes awesome 1080P video that transfers well using the EZiCAM app for the iPhone. The 1080P 60FPS setting yielded the best videos. Although it is able to shoot 4K videos, the frame rates are low 10-15FPS and 2.7K at 15-24FPS , making it a little jerky when played back, which you may want to keep in mind if you are looking for stellar quality 4K. The pictures are much more crisp than the previous camera and best when taken outdoors. Overall, I am very satisfied with this camera and will definitely be taking it on trips. I plan to buy a few more batteries as it shoots for about 1hr on the 1080P setting. Added bonus that it comes with the carrying case, many attachments, waterproof casing, and wireless clicker to trigger photos and video (if the camera itself is on a selfie stick or placed somewhere out of reach). It comes with a 32gb micro SD, but I have been using a 64gb one just for more storage, which will hold 6hrs of video and 11,000 12MP photos according to the camera. Overall very satisfied.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a 4K video camera. On a 1080p monitor 4K video does not look any better than 1080p video, but because 4K in this camera does 10 frames per second the video looks choppier using 4K than in does in 1080p. Some camera support more frames per second at 4K, this is why I am not ranking this camera as 5 stars. When is 4K useful without having a 4K display? If you need to blow up an image (say to get a license place after an accident) then 4K gives you more pixels to work with. If you do own a 4K TV/monitor then you can take full advantage of 4K video.In attached video I show video taken under different conditions and resolutions (1080p, 4K, day and night). Keep in mind that Amazon compresses video of video reviews, plus to get under the size limit on video reviews I had to compress it as well so you get much lower quality of video, watch it as a post stamp video as it better represents the overall video experience than full screen after compression.The colors and clarity of is quite good. The 170° lens provides a very wide view, but as any lens with such wide angle causes barrel distortion. The video under low light condition is good, however focus is not as sharp as during day time. It also does not handle well when the camera goes from the shade to the light (for example, driving from under the bridge into the light) it briefly badly overexposes. I am including example of what I mean in the attached video.The camera user interface is menu driven and is well organized. Navigation however is not the most intuitive. There are no dedicated forward and back buttons. All buttons are overloaded with several functions depending on what mode the camera is in.This camera as a couple of nice unique features.(1) The front of the camera has a display which shows the status. I find that front display useful when the camera is mounted with an accessory that covers the LCD screen. The front display tells if the camera is recording or not.(2) Another nice feature is a remote for starting/stopping video or taking photos. When the camera is mounted out of reach this remote is very handy. It is very simple, it has only two buttons - camera (takes a photo) and video (toggles video on and off), but it works very reliably.(3) This camera support live video and saving the video to micro sd card at the same time. Not all cameras that can do this.Live video via WI FI works very well: it was easy to connect the phone to the camera and the delay between action and live video is minimal (you can see it in my video). The app for live product is called Ez iCam (I show the install and how the app works in the video).The camera supports micro SD cards up to 32GB (the micro SD card is included).To recharge the camera takes about 3 hours from empty, I am getting about 2 hours of video on one charge.The package includes a large number of clamps and holders as well as a waterproof case. The manual is okay, it does not have instructions for every button but it was enough for me to find the right app and to figure out how to use the camera.I received this camera for testing and review. I covered pluses and minuses of my experience. I really like the frontal display and the remote. The video is very good under some conditions, but not all. I like the ability to record video and look at Live video at the same time. If you have questions on something I did not cover post a comment and I&rsquo;ll do my best to answer it.Ali Julia review</p>

<h5 id="better-than-the-specs-in-the-product-description-listed">Better than the specs in the product description listed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This looks like a great little camera, just used it inside at my desk tonight. A couple of points of clarification, the high-resolution video recording is actually a bit BETTER than what was listed in the description. From the camera settings and manual (have NOT verified from recorded video) it will record in 4K at 25fps (not <sup>15</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> fps as listed) and in 2.7K video it will record at 30fps (not <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>15</sub> fps as listed).</p>

<h5 id="pretty-nice-i-do-love-these-fake-go-pros">Pretty nice! I do love these fake go pros</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty nice! I do love these fake go pros, for a fraction of the price I&rsquo;m getting some seriously good video. The pictures leave me wanting a bit. But the fact that it does have 4k is sweet. The fps is only 15 however, so I end up sticking to the lower res videos at higher fps. Comes with a card, battery, remote trigger and all the listed accessories! The price dropped significantly just before I bought so i was excited about that!!Update 10.3.16I got the chance to use this camera on Mount Katahdin while I was hiking the Knife&rsquo;s Edge all the way to the peak/summit which is also the end of the Appalachian Trail&hellip;.well, this camera does take some great video for the price. I didn&rsquo;t use 4k at all because the frame rate is too low. I ended up w/ 1080p and well, the video that came out looks pretty good. What is sad is that many times I started the video and saw that it was recording, then I mounted up and went hiking. Well, when I took breaks I found out that the video camera froze at 5 seconds which was enough time for me to check, mount, and hike and then a good portion of the trail is lost because of the frozen image. What&rsquo;s more is that the camera ran through 2 fully charged batteries in less than 1 hour of hiking the Knife&rsquo;s Edge, and not even being used for a good portion of this part of the trail. Weather conditions also could not have been more perfect, no wind, 60F, good sun, dry&hellip;.so no influence there. I had the freezing problem no less than 5 times and only caught on after the 2nd time which was enough to loose a good amount of the trail. Have to drop to 3 stars. When it takes video, it looks good. Not choppy, but It&rsquo;s unclear when it will actually take the video you want.</p>
