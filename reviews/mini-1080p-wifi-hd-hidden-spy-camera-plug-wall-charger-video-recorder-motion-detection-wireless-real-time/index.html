<h5 id="charging-and-camera-is-ok">Charging and camera is Ok!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little device is incredible. So you are getting a wall charger (for USB cables) but you are also getting a camera that gives you live feed and sound of what going on in that specific area. I mean what can I say, I love gadgets like these that work.Is very easy to use.Just connect first to the camera network and download the app, then once you can watch a local live feed you can change it to you wifi setting in the app so that you can continue watching the live feed from a far.No one will know you have a camera in this little device.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-expecting">I&rsquo;m expecting</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>downloaded the app and the picture came right up. I love being able to see my home when I am not there. I set it for motion detection and it works great. I truly love this camera. The picture is great. I put a SD card in it and you still can&rsquo;t tell that its a camera. I will suggest this item to my family and friends for several reasons. It is so easy to set up. It has a very clear picture and you have the option to use motion activation. You can keep an eye on things at all times.I recommend</p>

<h5 id="great-little-camera">Great little camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super awesome little camera. it works perfectly. I just plug it in and have the app on my phone . It really does look like adapter . Also the picture is clear as anything I honestly wasn&rsquo;t even expecting that. Definitely something I would recommend no matter what you are using it for.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-perfect">Good product, perfect.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WNAT Adapter Camera came in a compact retail packaging. The appearance of the adapter camera in shape and size is virtually identical with a USB adapter that I have at home. The lens of the camera is very nicely concealed in the front and it is impossible to detect unless you hold in in your hand and try to look for it intentionally. It has a nice and smooth black finish to it and feels like a good quality unit. The instruction manual is written in very small fonts but it covers all you need to get this unit connected to your home network. I tried the installation on my Android device by downloading the free APP from Google Play and just followed the step by step instructions from the manual. It is actually very easy. All the features of this WiFi camera are controlled using the App, and it is very user friendly to use. You can set the camera to continuous or motion detection mode. The lens also has a very good viewing angle, and I had in plugged in to a low wall outlet in my house and it was actually perfect for the recording coverage area and really no need to place it at a wall outlet more at an eye level. The recording can be done on a memory card. All together this is a nice hidden surveillance camera, works as expected and very good picture and sound quality of recording as well.</p>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it</h5>

<p>This is absolutely the easiest camera I have ever set up. I downloaded the app and the picture came right up. I love being able to see my home when I am not there. I set it for motion detection and it works great. I truly love this camera. The picture is great. I put a SD card in it and you still can&rsquo;t tell that its a camera. I will suggest this item to my family and friends for several reasons. It is so easy to set up. It has a very clear picture and you have the option to use motion activation. You can keep an eye on things at all times.It can also charge for the phone, really very convenient</p>

<h5 id="perfectly-working-wall-adapter-with-hidden-pinhole-camera">Perfectly Working Wall Adapter with Hidden Pinhole Camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Lately, I have been exploring a few options for hidden cameras and came across this hidden spy camera from Corprit. It appears to be a USB wall adapter, but in reality it is recording video and these recordings can be streamed live to your phone. Because the covert pinhole camera in the front is nearly impossible to detect, no one will know they are being recorded so this is perfect for home / office surveillance or for monitoring a new babysitter.I was very surprised with how small the box was and the camera itself. I downloaded the app &ldquo;iMiniCam&rdquo; onto my iPhone (it also works on Android) and got started after going through the instructions manual. The setup is quite simple and relatively quick as I have had experience with similar devices. Because it is also portable, you can bring it if you go on a lot of business trips and want to watch your hotel room. This also features motion detection is notifies you when it detects something moving. That way, you don&rsquo;t have to constantly check and will always know when there is suspicious activity. It also supports loop recording function, meaning it overwrites the oldest files on the SD card if it full. You can adjust the image up to down, or left to right in the app. In addition to recording, the device also acts as a functioning USB wall adapter to charge your devices.</p>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera is just the right size!Its lens is hidden very well, generally no one will pay attention to it， It easily plugs right into my wall. I also really like how you can still use it as a normal USB adapter. It is able to charge my devices very efficiently. However, more importantly, the camera video quality on this is great! It is able to film very clear footage. I found the instructions very helpful for setting up the camera. I have also been very impressed with the actual camera’s size. It has been a great device and I am happy I purchased it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommend">Recommend</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is also useful as a wall charger for USB cables. I&rsquo;ve seen things that appear to be something else but are actually cameras but this actually IS what it appears to be with a&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-camera">Good camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks exactly like a wall charger you use for your cell phone. At the same time, it&rsquo;s a hidden video camera..yep that&rsquo;s right it records video/photo.</p>
