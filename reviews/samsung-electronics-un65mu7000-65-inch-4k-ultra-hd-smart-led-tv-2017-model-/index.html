<h5 id="the-pros-cons-and-oks-for-samsung-s-un40mu7000-hr">The Pros, Cons and Oks for Samsung&rsquo;s UN40MU7000 (HR).</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:_______<strong><em>- What you expect in a Samsung design: slick, clean, and light.- I do like the titan sliver Y stands as they do provide a decent amount of stability if you’re not going to put it on the wall.- The color balance is extremely accurate when launching it up for the first time. I didn’t feel that I had to change the layout.- Saturated reds, blues, greens are well in their levels and no matter how high the brightness level I make it these primary color still perform beautifully.- No neutral pixels you’re going to find on this screen. By connecting my laptop to show off HD screensavers, this TV brought the incredible color detail of each one (an array of colors).- Yes, 4K is shown in all its glory when you get this.- Samsung Smarthub layout is pretty easy to master as connecting your Netflix account and even internet browsing is pretty simple to do (I still prefer google chrome since my phone will always be near me).- HDR is indeed a great experience to see when the lights are turned down. My HDR experience from Amazon as it’s currently one of the few that can give you the option to see its show under the HDR experience.- Found it really cool when I turn on my PS4 it immediately switches the display layout to its game mode without me even lifting the remote.- Playing GTA 5 I didn’t see any lag that’s enough to make a notice about (Beautiful experience when driving a car in GTA.).- All you need is to download Miracast on your computer and that’s it. I was able to connect to it right away.- Oneremote controller buttons have a nice push and they don&rsquo;t have any discomforts as you can everything you need if you don’t have your phone, laptop, or your gaming counsel around.- It&rsquo;s future proof, this is not a 4 year and be done with it. You will be good for a while.Cons and Oks:</em></strong>____<strong><em>- There are hardware glitches upon digging deeper into the system. Scrolling with the remote does have some notice lag as well as sometimes I have to press an option twice to get a layout to open. I would assume future updates will fix this issue.- A decent amount of input layouts to get where you need to go. It’s a learning curve as it’s something you’re not going to learn in a day.- Playing HDR content the brightness isn’t the best around. It’s not bright at all and it’s something to take note if you’re planning to put this in an open floor panel.- The viewing angles are not good as I notice that the picture quality depletes if you move, from the center to the left and right of the screen. I would think after 6 feet away from the center you’re going to see a loss in quality (It&rsquo;s really not the much, but something you should know.)- Pretty expensive given what the market is offering for the same in software quality.- The brightness issue throughout the television is something to note, this is not only HDR.- The black levels are good but I’m sorry, OLED TVs excel in this area.- The remote itself can’t always be reliable as I recommend you use your phone for most of the interaction.Bottom Line:</em></strong>_______Samsung has provided a great design and picture quality for this and it’s indeed future proof. The color content is spot on and integrated smart TV with 4k is a bundle of joy. Put it on the wall and it’ll look like a picture while the HDR experience will prepare you for the future of viewing.There are some hiccups that need to be addressed with this design as HDR isn’t much on the market yet and shouldn’t be a must have feature right now (will be in the future). Software glitches and brightness issues are something to take note when buying this layout. You will have lag sometimes when using the remote as I try to get the most of my experience with the phone. Not only that but you will find cheaper TV’s with the same layout that this one has.Overall these cons are really not significant to change your mind as the main question you need to ask is whether you prefer OLED instead. As a Samsung user for many years, each TV made by them will hold its ground well beyond the expected breaking point. They put great care into making their TV’s and is why the brand is one reason you need to take into account before you buy. Verdict: A beautiful TV with an indecent price layout, given what the market is spitting out.Hopefully I was a help to you.Love,Honest Reviewer</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This TV is amazing. The colors and brightness are superb. I use it with my Ps4 Pro and my Pc at full 4K HDR. The text are sharp and colors are perfect. The sounds is&hellip; well I don&rsquo;t expect much from stock speakers on a TV this thin. It does have optical out but not analogue out, so keep that in mind to make sure it&rsquo;s compatible with your sound bar.This is pricey but for what you get really your only option in the TV space right now is the Sony 800, which is around the same price depending on where you get it. However, if you see them side by like the local store had them on display, there really is no comparison. The Sony is nice on it&rsquo;s own but cannot match the brightness and style of this Samsung.As a monitor it is really nice, it is only 60Hz, so you professional gamers may not be satisfied, but for us mere mortals this is great. I really couldn&rsquo;t tell the input lag difference from my monitor.</p>

<h5 id="great-way-to-start-your-4k-journey">Great way to start your 4k journey.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the big entertainment TV for the finished basement. Was a little bummed when I had to set up a delivery date a week out but I understand why. It is a big, expensive 65 inch TV. They can&rsquo;t just chuck it on the porch and run. But with Amazon Prime you get spoiled and expect stuff in 2 days. With that said, it was worth the wait. The guys who set it up did a great job and were in and out in probably a half hour. The TV is really, really nice. When viewing 4k content, you really see the difference and I was perfectly happy with 1080p resolution.This TV delivers a stunning picture even on non HDR stuff. I won&rsquo;t pretend I am a TV guru, with facts about contrast ratios and white balance dEs, I just know when I get a Samsung TV it doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. It is my understanding this model is either the top tier of the entry level series or the middle of the road series. Either way, you should expect that it has a few more bells and whistles and a bit snazzier and maybe a few more options than the bare bones entry level model but its performance can&rsquo;t be compared to a $3,000 OLED TV either. Apple and oranges. It is like saying an Accord doesn&rsquo;t deliver the refined craftsman ship and smooth handling of a Jaguar. Yeah, I guess not. For the money, I think this a a real value and I read several reviews from independent sources that indicated the same thing. Ready to go big, and dive into 4k viewing, I can&rsquo;t think of a better place to start.</p>
