<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="quiet-as-a-mouse-should-be">Quiet as a Mouse should be</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I use this with my tablet. It&rsquo;s very quiet. You hear more of a very slight &ldquo;thud&rdquo; than a &ldquo;click&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve dropped this a few times and it always remains working and quiet. Watch the short video to compare clicking of other brands of mice. The Srocker is a great buy for a durable, quiet mouse.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="almost-perfect">Almost Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been using this mouse for a month, so far it is still working. With all the negative reviews in terms of durability, I&rsquo;ve taken extra care in handling the mouse and USB receiver. The build quality of this mouse doesn&rsquo;t compare to Logitech or Microsoft, and is what you would expect with anything made from Chinese companies. No idea if this thing has trace amounts of lead or mercury. I hope I don&rsquo;t get cancer from using this thing.Some things to note:1. Contrary to what is implied in the name, this thing is not &ldquo;soundless&rdquo; at all, but quiet enough to not bother people sitting nearby.2. Works on most surfaces (no to marble and glass).3. The sensor on the bottom emits a bright pulsating red light.4. It&rsquo;s made by a random no-name Chinese brand.5. Instructions and description are in broken English.6. Requires one AA battery, not included. No idea on how long this thing will last.7. Opening the compartment on the bottom can be loud if not done correctly.8. The scroll wheel is silent, but will get noisier the faster you scroll.9. There is no on/off switch. To turn it on, plug in the receiver and click on any of the mouse buttons. It&rsquo;ll automatically turn off once it&rsquo;s idle.10. Sometimes the mouse would auto sleep while in use. Pretty annoying.11. Does not require software installation and it happens automatically when you plug in the USB receiver for the first time (for Windows 10 at least).12. There are only 3 buttons: left click, right click, and scroll click.13. This mouse is ambidextrous.14. Feels comfortable in my medium-sized man hands.</p>

<h5 id="great-scroll-wheel-but-i-m-pretty-sure-mine-is-defective-update-died-less-than-a-month-of-use-new-update-refund-issued">Great scroll wheel but I&rsquo;m pretty sure mine is defective. (Update: died, less than a month of use) (New update: Refund issued)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think my mouse might be defective and so most likely isn&rsquo;t typical of the product. For the most part it works fine but every once and while the mouse pointer starts jumping around in the vicinity of where it should be. If I pick the mouse up and shake it frenetically it usually stops and is fine for several hours. I don&rsquo;t use the mouse for anything requiring precision but if I were are gamer or an artist - well I would be using this mouse then anyway would I.Anyway it isn&rsquo;t annoying me enough to bug the company or Amazon and I like the feel of the scroll wheel which is the most important factor for me.Update: Left mouse button stopped working. Completely useless nowUpdate 2: The company contacted me after this review offering a full refund. They asked me a few rounds of questions with the aim of improving the product and promptly issued the refund. So, great customer service and I suspect merely a defective device not an indicator of the usual item which I am unable to review.</p>

<h5 id="super-quiet-mouse-perfect-for-the-office">Super quiet mouse! Perfect for the office!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this mouse! I love the price, I love how quiet the clicker is on the mouse and I love the look of the mouse. At first I was nervous about purchasing a white mouse and worried about how dirty it would get, but I have been continuously using this mouse for 5 months+ and it is still clean looking. If it ever does look a little dirty, I take a baby wipe to it and it cleans right up. I am probably going to end up purchasing a couple more. One for home and one as a back up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-companion-for-the-chromebook">Perfect companion for the Chromebook</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m using this mouse as I work this review robot. Bought it to go with a new little white Acer Chromebook R 11 Convertible, 11.6-Inch HD Touch, Intel Celeron N3150, 4GB DDR3L, 32GB, Chrome, CB5-132T-C1LK and it&rsquo;s a perfect match. Wheel wakes up the machine when I have it open. It&rsquo;s precise and isn&rsquo;t too fast and isn&rsquo;t sluggish. Did I say I like it a lot? The white is attractive and I love the turquoise blue accents on the side which are same color as wheel. No, there&rsquo;s no fancy little light to use up the battery. Mouse goes to sleep and conserves battery when unused in a while. How long I&rsquo;m not sure, but it&rsquo;s quick to wake up. Just roll the wheel forward to back and it will wake up the screen and the mouse, too. Do recommend.</p>

<h5 id="great-mouse">Great mouse!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What a great purchase!! I wouldn&rsquo;t exactly call it &ldquo;silent&rdquo; (there&rsquo;s definitely a clicking noise, although it&rsquo;s much quieter than my other mouse).The clicking function feels smooth. The mouse feels comfortable in my hand. The matte texture makes it so your hands don&rsquo;t get too sweaty (a problem I have with shinier-finished computer mouses).The con I see is that you can&rsquo;t turn it off, so it must run out of batteries quickly. I&rsquo;ve only had this mouse for 1 day, so I can&rsquo;t comment on its longevity yet. I&rsquo;ll update this review later if I feel like I need to comment on how long the battery lasts.So far, very impressed and very glad I made this purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-under-10-wireless-mouse-every">Best under $10 wireless mouse every</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is the best under $10 radio (wireless) mouse I have every purchased/used. I now have purchased 5 of these. Really good feel, smooth, and quiet. The only thing that I noticed is it stalls (goes to sleep?) to quickly. But, I am sure that is saving battery life; just click and your working again. I purchased 6 different under $10 wireless mouse devices to compare, this one is by fair the best. Even so much that I replaced my $50 Logitech mouse at work that was cause finger fatigue after a couple of hours each day. This mouse is the perfect height and a good width. Many of the wireless mouse devices these days are getting to small for the hand.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product. Easy of use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, fits in my small hands nicely, very silent, even the wheel is silent</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-in-the-first-week">Broke in the first week</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Dropped it once, from a height of about 4 feet, onto a carpeted floor. The cursor still works, but the buttons don&rsquo;t.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-quality-usb-reciever">Poor Quality USB Reciever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my second purchase of the SROCKET V2 silent mouse. Just like the first one, the USB receiver broke off my laptop after about 3 months of use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="would-recommend">Would recommend.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, good value. Would buy again</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! Love the silent clicker part</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-clicking-noise">No clicking noise.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got my mouse on time and packed well. I am using it now and like that I have no clicking noise. Fast enough for me too. Pretty smooth. Need to get one more for travel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love">Love</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In love with this mouse. Light weight and super cute</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="srocker-v2c-2-4ghz-wireless-mouse">SROCKER V2c 2.4GHz Wireless Mouse</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Had a little problem with it working at first!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-mouse-both-click-and-scroll-are-silent">Good mouse - both click and scroll are silent</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not knowing the brand, I took a chance. Very happy with the mouse. Use at work with mouse a foot from my speakerphone. No one has noticed my click or scrolling while presenting.</p>
