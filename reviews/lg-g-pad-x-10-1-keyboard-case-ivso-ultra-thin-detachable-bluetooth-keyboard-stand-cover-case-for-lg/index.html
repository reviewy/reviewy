<h5 id="let-me-assure-you-that-all-the-holes-and-needed-access-were-a-perfect-fit-for-my-g-pad-2-10">Let me assure you that all the holes and needed access were a perfect fit for my G pad 2 10</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>OK for starters I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve already read many positive reviews about this case. I want to simply say order it without hesitation because it is &ldquo;The One&rdquo; to get. When I was browsing and looking at the pictures I wasn&rsquo;t sure if all the holes aligned in the right places yet I ordered it anyways. Let me assure you that all the holes and needed access were a perfect fit for my G pad 2 10.1. Also the simulated leather has a nice feel as it is padded. And a nice look with the stitching. The keyboard is removable and is all one piece with the tray it is in, thus the whole keyboard tray removes together making it much thinner and easier to put in a purse if needed. The kickstand works well and locks in position until unlocked. Others fall back at the first sign of movement. The metal inside the cover dims the screen upon closing it. I like the way the tablet is enclosed and protected, much better than the rubber band holder types on other brands of similar price. In fact I knew my order would take some time to arrive and I didnt want to take a chance on damaging my G pad so I purchased a Onn brand locally to use in the mean time. Wow the Ivso case is so much better in every way possible and for a few dollars less too. Needless to say the Onn gets returned soon. My only negative is that my order took almost a month to arrive and I was given a date to date delivery expectation time frame and gladly it arrived on the first day of that window. End summary: Buy it because it is worth the wait unless you have Amazon Prime then you can get it in a couple of days!</p>

<h5 id="great-case-turned-my-tablet-into-a-mini-laptop">Great case&ndash; turned my tablet into a mini laptop</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Highly recommendMakes my tablet feel like a professional laptop nowAt first it was confusing to put the tablet inside the holder, and in the beginning worried it might break if I continually took it in/out but there so far hasn&rsquo;t been much need to take the tablet out of the case except to change SD cards anywayKeyboard works great! In the beginning was also a little confused by it and had a hard time connecting it (my own issue, not a technical one)Basically would be helpful if they included a little more instructions. Just saying &ldquo;be sure to sync keyboard every time you turn your tablet on/off&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t enough instructions for dummies like me lolOtherwise high quality product. Case is pleasant to touch, sturdy, makes my tablet feel so much more protectedI originally bought the official keyboard meant for the LG G Pad X 10.1 but quickly returned it once this one came. This one is so much better&mdash; MUCH better price, MUCH better quality, more bang for your buck (case and keyboard instead of just keyboard), etc</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case fit my lg g pad x perfectly. This is the at&amp;t version pad. It even has a pen holder on the side. The keyboard is removable. It charges very quickly and with ease. I had to pair it with my tablet once. Just remember to turn it off. It you leave it on it will die and you will need to recharge. The keys work great. The case closes shut with a magnet and the pad also attaches to the case by magnet.</p>

<h5 id="the-product-was-good-it-is-very-sleek-and-i-have-received">The product was good. It is very sleek and I have received &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The product was good. It is very sleek and I have received a lot of compliments on it. The thing I like the most is the vendor. I ordered two (one for my wife and one for me). I received both but there was a problem with one of the keyboards. I explained the problem to the vendor, they asked me to send them a picture of the issue which I did and then they sent me another one no questions asked. This is the way to do business. I love the cases and the keyboards as well.</p>

Easy to pair with tablet as most of you know with a Bluetooth keyboard they is a slight lag.

<blockquote>
<p>Wife uses it daily for school. Because it&rsquo;s for a tablet there&rsquo;s no mouse/touch pad (more of a technology issue), but she loves having a keyboard and the case is a very sturdy accessory. Only complaint is having to re-pair the keyboard with the tablet when the tablet is turned off then back on. Mild inconvenience at best. Worth the purchase.</p>

<h5 id="great-deal-for-a-full-complete-package">Great deal for a full complete package!!!</h5>

<p>Magnet that holds it closed is weak, and the pop up stand tilts the tablet at too sharp of an angle for my preference.</p>
