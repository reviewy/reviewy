<h5 id="looks-sharp-needs-instructions-you-can-actually-read-but-i-like-the-setup">Looks sharp needs instructions you can actually read but I like the setup.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The instructions were written so small that if you have any vision problems you can&rsquo;t read the size of drill bit as an example. If the instuctions were on a full sheet of paper with a normal font of 12-14 reading it would not be an issue. All the instruction are pictures with numbers so you obviously start with number 1 then keep going. Once you figure it out it&rsquo;s pretty simple at least for me since I have a stud finder. The cable management system is a bit of a joke. Reason I gave it 4 stars is even with the things I was unhappy with is when it&rsquo;s completed it looks really good. You have the option to put the three shelfs in whatever configuration you want. If you want the 3rd shelf to have a larger gap between the 2cnd shelf above it no problem. The shelfs are very easy to adjust but you will need a level because after you tighten them the will be a little crooked which easy to with your hands and a little pressure on one side. I am very happy with the way the shelf looks and it it happens to match a smoked glass desk that my wife uses in an extra bedroom so we got lucky because it looks like we had it all planned out.And the best part is I was sent this product for full price and I&rsquo;m providing my honest review. That is unlike some some sellers that give away free stuff to boost their reviews I paid full price the way a review system should work.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="small-and-unstable">Small and unstable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The directions included in the packaging were a little unclear: the pictures too small to see what was going on, etc. And some of the plastic ribbed pieces (wire organizers) were shorter than others, which leaves a little bit of a gap between segments. It might have been better if the segments snapped together or were otherwise attached to one another. Also, it might have helped if you had put the different kinds of screws in different bags. Normally I&rsquo;m not one to encourage <em>more</em> packing materials with products, but the similarity between the thin short bolts and the slightly wider short bolts was difficult to figure out at first.If you are installing this in a hollow wall (plaster, not on a stud, drywall, etc) really go to your hardware store and get some molly bolts. It will save you literally hours of frustration. DO NOT USE THE CRAPPY PLASTIC WALL ANCHORS THAT COME WITH THIS PRODUCT! THEY ARE LITERALLY THE CHEAPEST, CRAPPIEST ONE AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET.I was surprised to find that though this says it is specifically made for gaming consoles/ dvd players/etc, none of my consoles really fit securely on them, especially with all of the cords coming out of the back. I have a PS3, PS4, and xbox, and all of them hang over the edge of the shelves by a couple of inches.2 of the 3 shelves I can&rsquo;t get to be completely stable. they don&rsquo;t come out, but they easily tilt and wobble. Not enough that they are unusable, but enough to make me nervous trusting them with several hundred dollars&rsquo; worth of electronics.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-instructions-make-a-simple-assembly-too-difficult-but-the-outcome-is-nice">Poor instructions make a simple assembly too difficult, but the outcome is nice.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Made in China says a lot. The overall unit is quite good, but the assembly and some of the plastic inserts are not. The instructions suck. There are several small pictures with no language and some of the pictures contain multiple steps with no indication as to which one should be done first. Mounting the vertical bracket to the wall is easy, but then they combine the mounting of the shelves, the insertion of the top and bottom plastic caps, and the insertion of the plastic caps to cover the holding screws into one picture. The sequence is not specified, but if you fail to do it in a specific order you are in trouble. To make it worse, the plastic caps are very hard to fit on. I had to give up on a couple or it would have meant starting over.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-suitable-for-xbox-ps4-or-av-receivers">Not suitable for Xbox, PS4 or AV Receivers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good shelf. the side pieces that hide the wires are a little cheap and look a little tacky when you get up close, which nobody ever will, so it&rsquo;s not really an issue.My receiver did NOT fit on this, not even close. I have a Yamaha 7.1 receiver and had to buy another separate shelf to hold that. My Xbox One just barely/kinda doesn&rsquo;t fit on this shelf.If you&rsquo;re looking for something to hold your Roku or DVD player (who even uses those anymore) I guess it&rsquo;s a good shelf. Build quality is good and it&rsquo;s holding up fine after a few months. If you&rsquo;re looking for something to hold newer devices like PS4 or Xbox, look somewhere else.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-that-great-shelves-are-smaller-than-i-expected">Not that great. Shelves are smaller than I expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not that great. Shelves are smaller than I expected. I don&rsquo;t see any reason why the sides have to look like a comb considering they serve no purpose and those sides come in 6 pieces making it look seperated no matter what you do. The instruction literally included no words and the pictures are so small you cannot make out what they want you to do. It took less time to mount my TV than to add this. Many things could have been pre-assembled to save time, headache and error. While the thing does allow for cord housing, it doesn&rsquo;t allow enough room for all of the cords of a cable box, TV, modem and game system. Considering it gives you 3 shelves and is designed to run under a tv,it should allow that many cords. Cheap enough I guess but not that great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="insufficient-clearance">Insufficient Clearance</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>With this product, you definitely get what you pay for. I purchased these shelves for my living room to mount under my tv, which is mounted about 3&rsquo; from the floor. They intention was to place on the three shelves: the center channel speaker for my 5.1 system; my PS4 (slim model), and my nephew&rsquo;s XBOX 360. While these shelves are technically the perfect size to fit a PS4 or XBOX, this assumes your system doesn&rsquo;t have any wires sticking out of the back, which they obviously do. My PS4 slim when plugged in hangs about 2&rdquo; off of the front ledge, and the XBOX 360 had to be placed on the floor because it will not breathe properly resting on the vent (the built in legs for the system are off the ledge of the shelf so the system rests on the vent). The issue is that the shelves are an inch or less from the wall, so there is not sufficient room for the HDMI cord or power cable to stick out behind the unit, forcing placement off the shelf. I can&rsquo;t recommend this shelving unit for game systems, DVD/Blu-ray players, or audio receivers unless you are planning to store them on display without plugging them in for whatever reason. I will need to replace mine when I get the chance.</p>

<h5 id="overall-not-a-bad-product-not-impressed-with-the-soft">Overall not a bad product. Not impressed with the soft</h5>

<p>Overall not a bad product. Not impressed with the soft, plastic, curved wire casing. Most tv cables and electronic wires are nit flexible and thick.</p>

<p>Wonderful for kids room! Recommend for only 2 devices that are not wide ex. PS4 but perfect for Xbox One</p>
