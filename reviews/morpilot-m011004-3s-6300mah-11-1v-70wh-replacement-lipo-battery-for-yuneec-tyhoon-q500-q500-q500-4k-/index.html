<h5 id="upgraded-to-five-stars-very-good-company-to-work-with">Upgraded to five stars. Very good company to work with.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Battery works but the quality of construction is poor. The balance plug connector is misaligned, this makes it very difficult to charge. I had to modify my charger connector to make it work. If I wasn&rsquo;t needed the battery for a job I would have returned it.Changed to 5 stars. The manufacturer contacted me and shipped out a replacement at no charge. I have had the opportunity to use this battery in my drone and have seen an increase in 4-6 minute flight time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have flown multiple times with the stock Yuneec 500+ 5400mah batteries and was not unduly impressed with time in the air. Often beeing a new pilot I would just begin to get comfortable when the ST-10+ radio would beep and vibrate to tell me my flight time was getting short and I would realize the lights on craft were blinking.Put my only 6300mah MorPilot (New) battery in and videoed some of a front of house for friend and then it really was getting dark. Was not really thinking about battery time since no lights on craft were blinking. Let the friend begin to fly in the pitch dark and was recording with my cell phone and it was showing about 10 mins of recording done. Finally my friend landed the 4 copter and as yet no low battery warnings at all. Nearly 21 mins of flight and still no low battery warning. I was stunned. Maybe my OEM batteries were just &lsquo;old&rsquo;. Who knows? I just know I was very pleasantly surprised at time in the air with the 6300mah MorPilot battery. Yes, yes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good. Battery charges up and works great in my Q500 4k. Definitely an improvement over the 5400mah stock Yuneec batteries which simultaneously went bad after a year and 70-90 cycles.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-not-last">Does not last</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It has lasted maybe 10 charges and now won&rsquo;t charge. But they replaced the battery free of charge which I was very happy about.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="slightly-longer-charge-than-the-stock-batteries">Slightly longer charge than the stock batteries.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems good so far, only tested it once so far though.2-19-17 UPDATE:Only had used one of these, which was doing fine but today took the second one out of the box and see it has become slightly swollen. It charged fine and I tested it and got a good 20 min. use out of it but the swelling is a concern and should not happen in this amount of time when it was never used so next time might buy another brand. I expect to try to use it another couple times and will keep an eye on the swelling.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-buy">good buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This battery adds aprox 4 minutest over the flight time of the 5200mAh depending on your camera use during flight of the bird. It is good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought two, have made 1 flight with each. Shipping was average, I believe it was 7 days as I ordered on a thursday or friday.Seems to extend fly time over factory battery by a few minutes. Hard for me to know for sure as I was flying in wind and 10-20° weather. So far so good!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-that-great">Not that great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought the battery in December used about 3 times alright battery but having problems putting into the charger and the drone. Could be due to the battery&rsquo;s connector not properly aligning up having to put it in and out a few times before it goes into the drone. Has also blown the fuse on my charger twice no biggie just replaced the fuse, but really wished the connector was better.</p>

<h5 id="battery-lost-all-power-about-6-minutes-into-flight">Battery lost all power about 6 minutes into flight, &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Battery lost all power about 6 minutes into flight, instantly dropped my drone into 25 feet of water, over a lake, controller said still had 70 percent battery, DO NOT BUY THIS&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cheap-and-it-shows">Cheap, and it shows:(</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Battery performed well initially, but severely swelled after less than 10 charges. I am not going to take a chance on loosing my quad, or having a fire caused by a faulty battery.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-of-bloating">Beware of BLOATING!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered 3 through work and I have had these batteries for less than 3 months and all 3 of them are now bloating.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-i-gave-it-a-full-charge-and-full-flight-test-and-worked-just-fine-with-no-concerns">but I gave it a full charge and full flight test and worked just fine with no concerns</h5>

<p>I was skeptical with this as with any generic purchase, but I gave it a full charge and full flight test and worked just fine with no concerns. For the price&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-battery">Great battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great battery for over half off. 6 flights so far and no issues. Will be buying another</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-on-drone-batteries">Great price on drone batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Delivery was on timeBatteries work greatSo far satisfied</p>

<p>Battery lasts as long as OE for half the price. This is a no brainer!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="failed-in-less-than-90-days">Failed in less than 90 days</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite taking care when charging, storage, and use this battery has started to swell right at three months. I believe I probably have less than 10 charge cycles on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bad-product-do-not-last">Bad product. Do not last</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2.1 looked inflated.Neither last 3 flights.Bad product.I assume the original Yuneec battery worth the price.</p>

<h5 id="works-just-as-good-as-factory-battery">Works just as good as factory battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works just as good as factory battery, but at a fraction of the price.Have since ordered several, all with no problems. Will be ordering plenty more.</p>
