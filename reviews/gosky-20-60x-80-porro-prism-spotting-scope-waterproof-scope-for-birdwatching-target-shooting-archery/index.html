<h5 id="excellent-spotting-scope">Excellent Spotting Scope!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I researched a lot of spotting scopes before settling on this one. The description for this GoSky scope did not list the glass used and the numbers didn&rsquo;t add up right to me. I found the identical scope on ebay with two different branding names both from china like this one and all for about the same price (except the GoSky includes the digi-adapter). Both those ebay scopes have BK7 glass and the following numbers: 1200 grams weight, field of view 94ft@1000yds@20x and 53ft@1000yds@60x, eye relief 18-15mm and exit pupil 4-1.33mm. These numbers looked correct for this size scope. Based on the ebay info for the others I decided to order this GoSky spotting scope assuming its numbers would really match the others.I&rsquo;m glad I did! I found the weight to be 1200 grams just like the others so I believe the glass to be BK7 and I also believe the numbers to match the other ebay scopes. I also found the image quality to be excellent. It&rsquo;s crystal clear at 20x and the images are also quite clear at 60x when using the digi-adapter with my cell phone which takes pictures using voice commands. Remember that atmospheric effects (like heat waves) on image quality are amplified at higher powers. This affects all scopes.So I find this GoSky to be an excellent, nicely featured, well built spotting scope. The price makes it simply unbeatable.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-spotting-scope-and-phone-adapter">Excellent spotting scope and phone adapter</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent spotting scope and phone adapter. I can see my shooting targets at varied distances with very good clarity. I can see from 5 yards to 500 yards that I have tested so far. I would recommend these items as a good buy for a great price. Arrived on time and in a very secure package</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="image-is-clear-focus-is-easy-and-the-zoom-is-smooth">Image is clear, focus is easy and the zoom is smooth.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far the Gosky 20-60x80 has worked great. I am able to see very long distances approximately 2000 yards with nice clarity. The optics on this scope are very good. Image is clear, focus is easy and the zoom is smooth. This is a good scope for the money, and much better than my last 60mm spotting scope. The pictures attached were taken with my iphone 6s and digiscoping adapter near the lake in my hometown. The house with red roof is on the other side of the lake at about 1500yards. The house with grey roof is at about 500 yards. Scope was at the lowest 20X magination and mounted on a full size tripod. I used the phone zoom and also a Gosky wire shutter for smart phone to remove the vibrations.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-view-and-magnification">Excellent view and magnification</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted an 80mm objective for the extra light gathering power. I am very happy with it!I can see such clarity for bird watching or looking at the moon. It is best used in 20-40 magnification range and do the job nicely. It&rsquo;s easy to use. Its focus ring/eyepiece is also simple to use. For the price range it provides excellent view and magnification.</p>

<h5 id="it-views-well-for-100-yard-targets-for-ar15-or-22-ammo-through-paper-target">It views well for 100 yard targets for ar15 or 22 ammo through paper target.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having previously been disappointed with the image quality on cheaper scopes, but I¡¯m satisfied with the quality of the Gosky 80 spotting scope. It views well for 100 yard targets for ar15 or 22ammo through paper target. And, with the phone holder, I can zoom in so close.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-scope">Awesome Scope</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This scope is outstanding. I have 3 other astronomical telescopes including an 8&rdquo; reflector. When I received the GoSky spotting scope today I thought it just might be a piece of junk for $129. Boy, was I wrong. I do not have a single complaint. Even my solar filter to view sunspots fit over the 80mm objective lens. Excellent image quality and solid build.Buy this scope. You will be very pleased</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-scope-for-the-money">Good scope for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Scope is pretty good. I have used better quality scopes but not for this price. The scope is nice for less that $200 and it comes with a table top tripod and a soft case. It also comes with a phone clamp to take pictures. The phone attachment does not work on my droid MAXX phone so I don&rsquo;t have much use for it. It might work better on an I phone, I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-scope-works-very-well-with-excellent-clarity-no-problem-seeing">This scope works very well with excellent clarity. No problem seeing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This scope works very well with excellent clarity. No problem seeing .17 caliber holes in a target at 100 yards. I know there have been some less glowing reviews, but this scope has more than met my expectations. Considering the low cost it is a phenomonal value. The tripod takes a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it, it works well. The elevation crank handle on the tripod is probably the weakest part so just make sure the centerpost is free before working the crank handle because placing too much pressure on it could cause it to break easily. So, just use a little caution and I think you will be very satisfied with this scope, plus the purchase won&rsquo;t put you in the poorhouse or get you in trouble with your spouse!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ok-for-the-range-not-so-good-for-the-field">OK for the range, not so good for the field</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You get what you pay for. You&rsquo;re paying for a decent spotting scope. Anything over 100 yards and you&rsquo;ll be disappointed. Fogs up in humid conditions.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fairly-happy">Fairly happy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very happy with scope. Camera adapter works well on my old galexy phone. Tripod leaves a lot to be desired.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-easy-to-set-up">Very easy to set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First scope I bought. It is compatible with my iphone 6s very well. I was trying to catch a photo for a bird, but bird gone. LOL. Marks 3 magnifications. Very easy to set up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="watching-bird-in-my-backyard">watching bird in my backyard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This scope come with many accessories for you phone. you can adjust different angle for different phone. I use camera tripod to watch birds in my back yard which is so much fun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-works-excellent-for-both-purposes">It works excellent for both purposes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought to glass for game animals and call long range shots. It works excellent for both purposes. I leave it on 20x most the time to maintain a bright, crisp, and clear image.</p>
</blockquote>
