<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-for-carnivorous-plants">Great for carnivorous plants!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use these grow lights on my Venus Flytraps. They require a lot of bright direct light, or their trap interiors don&rsquo;t get that gorgeous red color. These LED lights have given them that color, to my surprise! Very well built, and incredibly low on heat, even thought I run them for 16 hrs/day! Incredibly happy with this purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-indoor-growing">Great for indoor growing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, very bright for 12 watts. making this bulb highly efficient.. Purchased 3 bulbs. Great for indoor growing. Picture is one bulb.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-pleased-with-it-so-far">I am pleased with it so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this lamp for a 2 yr old Meyer lemon tree so as to ensure it received enough light through the winter. I am pleased with it so far, as Ice only had it for a few weeks. It doesn&rsquo;t get hot so it&rsquo;s safe to leave on for an extended period of time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="seems-to-work-well">Seems to work well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to do the job. Plants are still alive. Puts our little to no heat, but be careful, it can burn the leaves of sensitive plants. I positioned the light about 5-7 feet away and it still burned the leaves of one my sensitive plants(cape sundew), but the rest were fine (purpea pitcher, venus flytraps). I have only used for it a little bit this time of year. As the days grow shorter and sun angle lower, I will use it more and update my review.Update 12/12/15 the light seems to work well. Be very careful with plants that are sensitive to light as it can burn them up, even from a 4-6 foot distance. Overall happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="all-in-all-it-s-a-great-bulb-for-my-needs">All in all it&rsquo;s a great bulb for my needs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Been using this light for over a month now. It was helped my plants grow new leaves. It will be a big help to me in the winter months because of less sunlight and my home doesn&rsquo;t get that much light to begin with. The bulb is a little heavy and generates a little heat but not that much. It&rsquo;s very bright and can be a little distracting at first is you are trying to read on the other side of the room. All in all it&rsquo;s a great bulb for my needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-m-giving-5-stars-because-it-looks-as-if-it">i&rsquo;m giving 5 stars because it looks as if it &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i&rsquo;m giving 5 stars because it looks as if it will work. I can&rsquo;t say for sure, the mice have eaten all the seedlings before they much more and germinate. Update. The light puts out plenty of light, but oner a narrow band. In a standard seed tray it will illuminate an area of two x3 pots.Plants grow well. Except for limited coverge I would say gret.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-plant-light-plants-growing-fast-inside-during-winter">Great plant light. Plants growing fast inside during winter.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Light is working great so far. Basil plant was dying in the winter and this light brought it back to life and made it grow a lot more. Now using it for multiple plants, so far so good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-find-that-my-plant-seems-to-grow-better-with-about-6-hours-of-exposure-with-this-light">I find that my plant seems to grow better with about 6 hours of exposure with this light &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Im using this light for my nepenthes pitcher plant. So far it seems to be working very well. I find that my plant seems to grow better with about 6 hours of exposure with this light even though the natural conditions of this plant requires about 4 hours of direct sunlight. so if you are using this light I recommend using it a little longer than the plants natural light requirements needed. Although this light seems to be doing very well, nothing can beet good old-fashion natural sunlight. But all in all, I would recommend this light for any plants.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="warning-this-killed-my-nice-tree">Warning - this killed my nice tree</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a tropical tree in my NYC apartment that was alive and green all winter, just from being by a window.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great for when the seedlings pop up.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-my-orchids-are-doing-nicely-under-it">but my orchids are doing nicely under it</h5>

<blockquote>

<h5 id="great-bulb">GREAT BULB!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bright and works great my plants were telling me they love this light by growing fast. I would buy another matter of factI need another.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-lights-and-a-good-price">Good lights and a good price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works as expected and keeping my spring/summer outdoor plants alive indoors during the winter months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-work">These work!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>You can tell a significant difference! Rotate the trays because plants with more direct light will really bloom faster than the ones on the outskirts.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>works great</p>
