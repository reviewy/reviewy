<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="this-makes-my-life-better">This makes my life better</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the best purchase I have ever made. Seriously. I have an iPhone 6-Plus, and using both magnets (included in the shipment) between the case &amp; the phone, it attaches onto the mount very firmly. The mount also attaches firmly into my air vent (2006 Nissan Xterra). No jiggling or slipping. I can touch, swipe, etc on my phone screen without any risk of the phone falling or sliding. Great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="almost-good-but-back-to-the-drawing-board">Almost good, but back to the drawing board</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to like this and it had potential, but I&rsquo;ve had this a week and the metal prongs are now exposed and it scratched up my air vent.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="strong-magnet">STRONG Magnet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had to use the metal plate to get a decent grip between my case and the mount. This magnet is STRONG. When you try to remove your phone, the magnet will come out of the vent. I usually brace the magnet with my fingers and slide the phone sideways to remove it. This is just a minor inconvenience. The only TRUE complaint I have it that the vent is blocked when the phone is mounted. My truck has round vents and the phone in its case blocks about 98% of the airflow.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nearly-perfect-the-only-issue-with-a-universal-product-is">Nearly perfect. The only issue with a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; product is &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nearly perfect.The only issue with a &ldquo;universal&rdquo; product is that it tries to do everything well, which means it ends up doing a sub par job. In this case, vent placement in many new cars is smaller, compact and conjusted which results in the phone facing upwards. Bigger phones are difficult to put in place. For instance in my Lexus RX, the vents are not spacious enough for me to have my iPhone 6s Straight. This results in a crooked placement for the phone. While in our second car, a Honda civic, it has plenty of room to move around and puts the phone at my eye level.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-product-but-will-scratch-vents">Good product but will scratch vents</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very effective with a strong magnet that holds my phone on tight. Make sure to use the side thats tighter to mount onto your vents for a firm grip or else pulling your phone off will pull the base off too. The one con is that the arms that latch onto the vents leave scratch marks, with or without the rubber piece. I tries to slip some cloth between the arms and vent but obviously that just allows the base to slip off easily.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised-but-a-couple-small-downsides">Works as advertised, but a couple small downsides.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that this product works really well for just letting you throw your phone up and have it ready to go in the car. I used the sticker style metal plate on my case and the only complaints I have about that are that on hot days, the glue gets really soft and the plate can come off the back. The other complaint is that if you use an Android phone with wireless charging, you can&rsquo;t have that disk on there. It gets &ldquo;burn your house down&rdquo; hot.Otherwise, if you don&rsquo;t use wireless charging or live somewhere super hot, it&rsquo;s good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For other drivers&rsquo; reference, I drive a 2006 Nissan Pathfinder and the car mount fits easily in the air vent to the upper left of the CD slot.I have tried a few different car mounts, but this is the only air vent car mount that I have kept for longer than a week. I like how small it is, and how easy it is to remove my phone when I leave my car. The only issue I have with it is that it doesn&rsquo;t withstand to some of the [VERY] bumpy roads in and around Boston. However, anyone who has driven in Boston knows that our roads here are atrocious, and out of the norm in terms of potholes, construction, etc.At first I was just using the small circular magnet, placed in between my phone and my clear Speck case, but found that the phone was falling off the mount at even the slightest bump in the road. I switched to the larger magnet and have only had my phone fall once in the past week and a half, and that was on a particularly bumpy road. As far as air vent car mounts go, this one is a great value.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-smooth-matte-feel-of-the-magnet">Love the smooth, matte feel of the magnet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my boyfriend and it&rsquo;s working out great so far! It comes with two thin metal plate adhesives in case you&rsquo;re using it with a case that isn&rsquo;t magnetic. Also has a metal plate without adhesive that can be slipped in the back of a case. We haven&rsquo;t tried that yet. The magnet has a soft, smooth matte feel and is super strong magnetically! It fits so snugly in his truck vent. Would definitely recommend because it&rsquo;s a simple, excellent design that doesn&rsquo;t look like an eye sore.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-easy-to-place-my-phone-to-dashboard-and-strong-enough">Very easy to place my phone to dashboard and strong enough &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to place my phone to dashboard and strong enough magnet to hold the phone from shock while driving.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="car-accessory-that-simplifies-everyday-driving">Car Accessory that Simplifies Everyday Driving</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this product! It makes using my phone safely in the car as a GPS so much easier! I love that is stays securely in place because of the magnet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Liked how they worked and just purchased one for my wife&rsquo;s vehicle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it">I love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great product! Highly recommended!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-using-this-mount">I love using this mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love using this mount. My phone doesn&rsquo;t move when I go over a bump, and I&rsquo;m not worried about tension breaking the fins on my air vents. <sup>10</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>, would buy again</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="make-sure-you-put-it-in-the-vent-that-s-smaller">make sure you put it in the vent that&rsquo;s smaller &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>make sure you put it in the vent that&rsquo;s smaller. it fell on my first attempt but when i switched to the passenger vent on the right of the radio and it hasn&rsquo;t fell since</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="magnetized-system-is-not-as-good-as-clipped-based-models">Magnetized system is not as good as clipped-based models</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It stays on the vent fine, but the magnet is not strong enough to hold a large phone. My phone kept falling off when driving over a large bump, railroad track, etc.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poorly-made-not-a-snug-fit-on-the-air">Poorly made, not a snug fit on the air &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Poorly made, not a snug fit on the air vent. While driving, I made a turn and the WizGear flew off the vent and my phone was tossed across the car.</p>
