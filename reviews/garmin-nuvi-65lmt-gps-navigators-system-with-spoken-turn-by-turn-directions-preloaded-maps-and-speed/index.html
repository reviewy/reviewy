<h5 id="it-s-garmin-need-i-say-more">It&rsquo;s Garmin need I say more</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>By far the best value of any navigation unit with this many features. Lifetime maps for lower 49 states. Great audio and video with 6&rdquo; display and 3D, keeps your eyes on the road not your smartphone. Many user settings with expandable micro SD card support up to 32gb. Optional wireless backup camera and baby camera. No turning you head around to see how your child is doing.</p>

<h5 id="thanks-for-the-prime">Thanks for the Prime</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought a refurbished unit and did not have success at first: the unit would not charge (power connector was broken). So I had to return it and bought another refurbished one (the same item). Interestingly, by that time the price dropped $10 and also the shipping vendor was changed, so Amazon did not charge me the state sales tax. So as a result I got $20 in savings. The second one is perfect - it took forever to start it the first time (it was looking 5 minutes for satellites and that scared me a bit), but after that it became instantaneous. It is intuitive, instantly finds satellites, quick on calculating routs and finding places. Compared to my previous two Garmins (one was junked because of the outdated maps and another was expropriated by my wife) it is much better in every way.Do not forget to hook it first to computer and download maps and software updates. The updating program is located directly in device’s memory – no separate CD of downloading from Garmin website is required – just hook it up and click on the installation program.</p>

<h5 id="traffic-updates-don-t-work">Traffic updates don&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The GPS works fine with the exception of the traffic updates. I was sent the wrong charging cord so the traffic updates don&rsquo;t work. This means I overpaid for this item and I am unable to get a replacement at the price I bought it at as the price changed over the past few weeks. Very poor performance Garmin!Update 1/10/2017I ended up contacting Garmin customer service about this item. It turns out that I couldn&rsquo;t exchange this item for another one because it is no longer being produced. When I told them about the traffic updates not working, they had me ship back thebitem to them for free and gave me a brand new updated GPS model it works great! Thank you so much Garmin!!!</p>

<h5 id="great-choice">Great Choice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent experience so far . Arrived timely and already updated .The instructions that come with it are not very good ,but if you&rsquo;ve ever used a GPS it&rsquo;s not a problem . I do recommend you buy the bean bag (?) for the dash of your car &ndash; I didn&rsquo;t and had to &ndash; for me from a placement / visibility standpoint it&rsquo;s much better than the attachment that comes with the Garmin . The 6&rdquo; size is perfect for me and with the bean bag ,I can move the Garmin so that there is minimal effect on road visibility. I recommend this product ( even though it was used / refurbished it looked brand new) ..</p>

<h5 id="it-s-a-nice-size-and-everything-works-well">It&rsquo;s a nice size, and everything works well</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a nice size, and everything works well, easy layout, and much faster than older ones. My only issue was the car charger cable. Mine did not work. I called Garmin and within about 15 minutes I had a replacement on the way. 2 days later it showed up. I didn&rsquo;t even have to ship the defective one back, which is always nice since packing it up and then finding a place to ship it from can be a pain.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Garmin nuvi 65LMT GPS Navigators System with Spoken Turn-By-Turn Directions, Preloaded Maps and Speed Limit Displays (Lower 49 U.S. States) (Certified Refurbished)Great price on this product. So far I have put this GPS Unit through it&rsquo;s paces and it has performed very well. I live out in the &ldquo;boonies&rdquo; but have taken this into the City a few times and have intentionally taken wrong turns to see how it redirects and so far , so good. I will be going from Maine to Florida next month and we will see how the traffic functionality works as well as other features. Nice large screen and I was able to mount it on the windshield fine with included mount. I have updated a couple times now which is very simple with a downloaded application on my desktop. The Garmin Express application for updating is available from Garmin&rsquo;s website. It was a very small download and immediately recognized my GPS unit after plugging in via usb cable (supplied).One thing to note : The unit came with very little charge. It would power on and get the &ldquo;GARMIN&rdquo; splash screen but shut down shortly there after. It needs to be charged with the adapter and not from a PC/Laptop usb port. Once charged with the Car adapter , everything was fine and was able to plug in to PC and update prior to first use.I would very much recommend this unit to anyone looking for a GPS solution for their vehicle.</p>

<h5 id="great-gps">Great GPS</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great GPS, nice big screen, gives names of upcoming streets as you drive along. Haven&rsquo;t used it to navigate a whole lot, but the few times I have it&rsquo;s been spot on. Love that it gives the current speed, speed limit, and a gentle ding when you&rsquo;re coming up to a school zone. Switches to night-mode instantly when starting the car at night, unlike the Tom Tom I have in our other car.</p>

<h5 id="very-good-gps-navigation-system-easy-to-use">Very good GPS navigation system, easy to use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good GPS navigation system, easy to use. It wakes up quickly when I start the car, and it gives good directions to any destination. The map display is clear and easy to set up for your preferences. One &ldquo;feature&rdquo; that I don&rsquo;t like is that it beeps and shows a warning every time I&rsquo;m approaching a school zone. As a teacher myself, I am concerned about school zones, but if you are driving through a typical residential neighborhood, you will get annoyed by the overly frequent beeping. I&rsquo;d like to turn off the beeps for school zones, and just go with the visual warning, but the &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; controls are somewhat limited, and I don&rsquo;t see a setting for school zone warnings. I previously used a Magellan GPS, and it had more customization settings, but it kept rebooting randomly, especially in hot weather, and Magellan&rsquo;s customer service was just about nonexistent, so I don&rsquo;t recommend that brand.</p>
