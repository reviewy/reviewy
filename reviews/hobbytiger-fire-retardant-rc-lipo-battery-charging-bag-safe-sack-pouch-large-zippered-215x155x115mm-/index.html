<h5 id="and-like-an-idiot-i-had-3-other-batteries-in-there">and like an idiot I had 3 other batteries in there &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This bag could have possibly saved my house! One of the batteries I was charging caught on fire in the bag, and like an idiot I had 3 other batteries in there with it. The bag got a bit charred but the fire did not escape it! The entire house still stinks many hours later. I just ordered another bag. They are not reusable after they are set on fire(-: Bottom line, the bag contained the fire and did exactly what it was suppose to do. I would definitely recommend this product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-mean-it-seems-to-work-so-far-bigger">I mean it seems to work so far, bigger &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean it seems to work so far, bigger than the LiPo bags and has a zipper instead of Velcro. I use it in combination with a 50 cal ammo box to store and charge my LiPo batteries.The ammo box I use can be found here ACM New MilSpec 50 Cal Ammo Can with Locking Hardware. See pictures for fit. I also use a single dehumidifier (New and Improved Eva-dry E-333 Renewable Mini Dehumidifier) inside the ammo box to keep everything dry.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="gives-me-a-peace-of-mind-with-my-batteries-stored-in-my-house">Gives me a peace of mind with my batteries stored in my house.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like the value of this battery bag.I use this to store my batteries and use a second bag to charge the batteries individually.This is very durable and makes for great portability.I keep the batteries in here both for storage as well as taking it out to the field.This really does give me peace of mind knowing that if something happened with a battery then it would likely be contained to this bag.I have not had a circumstance to where a lipo caught on fire so I can not attest to the fact of how fire retardant it is.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality">Good quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This lip carrying/charging bag is a top quality product. There is nothing cheap about it. The handles and zipper are pretty heavy duty and look like they withstand a good amount of use. The bag doubles as a carrying bag for my AC/DC portable charger as well so it serves two purposes in my case. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fireproof, lip charging/carrying bag.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-and-price">Great product and price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bag for its primary use. I have 4 shorty lipo batteries that I use this with. Cut some cardboard to size to separate them during transport. Probably can fit up to 8 shorty batteries in it. Will be purchasing another when I have my second car ready to race. Feel of bag is very nice, construction is high quality, zipper is used to close bag which is very strong better than velcro. Have had several other racers asking where I bought it and they were surprised at the low price on amazon. Definitely recommending this to friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-deal-after-researching-lipo-storage-charging-bags">Best deal after researching lipo storage/charging bags.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally a lipo fireproof charging bag that holds more than a couple batteries. I have 3 1300mah 3s 3 1300mah 4s and one 2200mah 3s and there is plenty of room for more maybe two or three times that if using 1300 mah 3s and 4s. I was nervous about using a plastic ammo case for batteries. The quality is spot on and the price is the best deal for the size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-price-great-protection">great price great protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good! Really like the size, can easily store or transport multiple lipos of practically any size. Truly believe this bag to be better quality than even my Protek bags which have been deteriorating internally, were more expensive and barely half the size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These Fire Retardant Bags are very flexible and yet heavy enough to stand as a “cube” when all the corners are pulled out. If you expect it to have a stiff bottom, they do not have that feature, but a piece of cardboard or something similar that you can spray with a fire retardant would do the trick. I don’t need that, so they are fine the way they are. They are heavy duly as far as construction goes. At one time I bought fiberglass bags to use for my purposes, and they tend to shred after a very short time. These are made to last as the zippers are tight and well sewn in. In fact all the parts, the handle, the zipper, the fabric cover all around this very light and flexible “box&rdquo; are sewn so well and put together in such a way that I could see these lasting for many years. I bought two, but they were so nice, especially for the money, that I reordered two more. I was a bit afraid I would not be able to find them again if I needed more. They are incredibly well made, again, as inexpensive as fire retardant products come, and bigger than they appear when you first get them. It is my pleasure to tell you they are worth the money and more. I use them for things like collectables and batteries of course, yet they are perfect product for anything you want to keep from burning up from a small fire, so I highly recommend them.</p>
