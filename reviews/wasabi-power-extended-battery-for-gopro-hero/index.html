<blockquote>
<p>This power pack is phenomenal! After fully charging both, my GoPro and this Wasabi Battery, I mounted this and began to record in 1080p (30fps) to see how long it will last. I did not power this pack on from the start. I waited until my GoPro was down to 1 bar before powering on this extended battery, in hopes that it was powerful enough (amp-wise) to actually charge my camera while recording, rather than just slow the depletion process. It was, to my pleasant surprise. In fact, once this extended battery was fully depleted and powered off, I was still able to continue recording for about an hour. All in all, I was able to continuously record for just over 8.5 hours with no issues. I was very impressed by this!Furthermore, the 4-LED level indicator is a great addition, as I&rsquo;d hate not knowing how much power I have left in the bank. Also, the backdoor fits flush, perfect, and the external button to power the battery on while closed may seem like a no-brainer, but I&rsquo;d purchased another similar product that did not have this. This allows you to power on the battery while fully submerged or wet without compromising the waterproof case. Finally, this battery pack has a little view window in the upper-right corner, allowing the GoPro&rsquo;s rear indicator light to pass through the battery very clearly, which is also great (which the other extended battery also did not have).Wasabi has clearly thought of everything and really did a great job on this product! They know their stuff &amp; I will definitely be coming back to them in the future!I realize now that my recording settings were not the most power-consuming (720p, 60fps, SuperView is) but it is still impressive, nonetheless.I highly recommend this battery pack as, in my research, it has even outperformed LimeFuel&rsquo;s similar product that claims to have almost twice the capacity of this product. I will be testing again to confirm but as of now, I was only able to get 5 hours out of their product with complications (battery pack powered off at the 4 hour mark &amp; I had to restart GoPro to continue recording). GoPro HERO Extended Battery Pack 4000mAh (Limefuel Epic L40GH) External Mini USB Includes Extended Backdoor Housing up to 40 Meters, for entry-level camera only NOT COMPATIBLE with Hero 4, Hero <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub>+ *Patent Pending</p>

<h5 id="a-must-for-gopro-hero">A must for GoPro hero!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great investment for your GoPro hero. Being a first time GoPro user I bought the base model to see if I&rsquo;d use it and how frequently before diving head first into a $300+ investment. My only complaint was battery life and the inability to switch batteries on the fly. This product solved that. Having twice the battery life is wildly convenient and makes my GoPro experience much much better. I&rsquo;ll be purchasing a second battery for backup in the near future. Highly recommend this product!</p>

<h5 id="pretty-close-to-a-must-buy-but-no-sound">Pretty close to a must buy but No Sound</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great battery life. It does increase the size of the GoPro but it&rsquo;s not that much different than the size of the original GoPro. Here&rsquo;s the problem with this battery No Sound. You can&rsquo;t record any sound because there is no skeleton back door for this. You can leave it open but that&rsquo;s just cumbersome. You can remove it but then you are relying solely on the mini usb to hold it in place and it does sag a little. It needs a skeleton back door to be included and this would be a must buy for the GoPro Hero. The battery is great. It&rsquo;s like having 3 times longer recording capability on the Hero. Right now you can&rsquo;t buy the back door separately otherwise I would have bought one and hit it with the dremel to make my own skeleton back door.</p>

<h5 id="well-worth-the-money-but-broke-the-lock-on-my-case">Well Worth the Money but Broke the Lock on My Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was a little skeptical when I read the reviews about how the product was not 100% waterproof, but then I realized that I wouldn&rsquo;t be filming underwater for extended periods of time so I bought it. I will say that the battery pack is moderately water resistant: I filmed a time-lapse in light rain and there was no major damage to report.This battery pack works like a champ. Forget buying GoPro&rsquo;s BacPac, for the same price, if not a bit more, you practically get double the performance and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about draining the GoPro&rsquo;s actual battery since you won&rsquo;t be using it.Battery pack is fantastic for time-lapses since it can carry so much power in a small, neat, and tidy form-factor. After shooting a time-lapse of my nearly 3 hour flight from IL to FL, the GoPro battery indicator still showed two fill bars. And I used it to charge my phone while waiting for the train to pick me up. Do note that leaving your GoPro on for extended periods of time will heat up the camera.The battery pack requires you to use the GoPro clear case that comes with your GoPro so the battery can mate with the GoPro. The problem I have with this is that after repeatingly opening and closing the case to get my SD card, one of the clips on the black lock hinge snapped and broke. The battery pack doesn&rsquo;t sit flush with the opening of the case so you&rsquo;re almost forcing the lock to deal with the tension and resistance to force the battery pack in. Also, the groove on the battery back that the black lock uses to clamp isn&rsquo;t recessed enough so sometimes you can improperly lock the case which also warps the hinges. The other hinge works however, but now I&rsquo;m gonna have to buy another clear case in the event the lock fails and the GoPro gets damaged if i want to film underwater; which isn&rsquo;t often.All in all, if you have the money for this battery pack, definitely make it one of the top accessories on your next &ldquo;Things to buy for my GoPro&rdquo; list. While the battery does add some heft to the GoPro, the weight won&rsquo;t weaken the integrity of any GoPro mounts or accessories. And, despite one of the hinges on my case breaking after repeated opening and closing, the trade-off is well worth the risk.Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Wasabi Battery extender is possibly the best battery or battery extension I&rsquo;ve found for the Gopro cameras. This one extends the battery life well beyond what the camera originally does and I would argue that it&rsquo;s actually better than any batttery that GoPro creates. That being said, it is a battery extension so it will weigh down your camera some and will make it incompatible with certain mounts.</p>
