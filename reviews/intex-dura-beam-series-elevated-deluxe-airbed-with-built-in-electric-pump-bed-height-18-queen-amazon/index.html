<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="airpockets-are-amazing">Airpockets are amazing</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased a couple of Intex airbeds already - knowing that I can depend on the quality of their products, I bought this airbed for when guests come over. A few different things that I noticed were the packaging and the actual airbed itself.This item came in a different packaging which I would assume is some type of Amazon special packaging. It&rsquo;s not a retail box but a brown box that notes what&rsquo;s inside. It didn&rsquo;t make a big difference to me since I already knew what I was going to get.The airbed itself was very comfortable. The air pockets are something new that the other Intex airbeds I own don&rsquo;t have. It&rsquo;s a small feature but makes a world of difference in regards to overall comfort. The size and height is perfect, my sister is 5&rsquo;1&rdquo; and fits on the bed sprawled out with room to spare. 18&rdquo; is high enough off the ground that it&rsquo;s not too awkwardly low to the floor or too high off the ground. It of course comes with the built-in pump which is convenient. The little compartment to roll the cord back into is not only aesthetically pleasing but adds a level of safety. I&rsquo;m extremely clumsy and can see myself tripping over this if it wasn&rsquo;t tucked away somewhere nicely.Overall a great quality bed, I would highly recommend. It also comes with a very convenient carrying case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-air-mattress">Best Air Mattress.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very sturdy air mattress. No plastic smell. Inflates very quick. Pump is included inside the mattress with long electrical cord and battery compartment for when you cant plug it in. Pump can be used to quickly deflate the mattress. No need to manually have to deflate or wait a long time to deflate. Edges don&rsquo;t sink when sitting on the edge. Stays inflated all night and then some.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Really solid air mattress, aired up on Thursday and didn&rsquo;t have to re air at all and took it down on sunday</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="glad-we-bought-this-one-survived-the-kids-camping-beach-in-laws-and-still-works-great">Glad we bought this one! Survived the kids, camping, beach, in-laws and still works great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have owned this intex mattress for a while now. It has survived camping for 5 days with 3 kids on it, it has survived a week at the beach, and it has survived my in-laws visiting sleeping on it for a week and as of right now it still hold air! I&rsquo;m very pleased with it and I&rsquo;m glad we bought it. It&rsquo;s super easy to inflate and takes no time hardly. It sleeps very well if you don&rsquo;t fit it completely up. We leave a little bit of air out of ours because it sleeps better and is way more comfortable when it isn&rsquo;t maxed out full of air! I did a lot of reading and research before we initially purchased this particular one. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend a fortune for something that didn&rsquo;t get used constantly and I didn&rsquo;t want to buy a piece of crap either that busted or deflated after the first time we used it. Research pays off because we are happy with this one!Update since last review- I took away 2 stars because the pump has started to act goofy on it. It sometimes works and sometimes don’t. While the pump worked this was the best air mattress we ever bought.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="comfy-and-convenient">Comfy and convenient</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Great Product. Was a little reluctant to purchase due to the bad reviews but couldn&rsquo;t have been happier. Initially there was some softening of the air mattress but I realized it&rsquo;s due to the valve not being set to the end after inflating. After that was no problem at all. Deflating is also a cinch!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-air-mattress">Great air mattress!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although so far I only sleot on it one night, It was super comfortable. Super easy to blow up and super easy to deflate, fold, and put in the carry case. Make sure you read the instructions regarding it losing air the first few times-because it actually is not losing air.. I just ordered the twin one..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-idea-horrible-execution">Nice idea, HORRIBLE execution.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mattress failed the second time I used it. I inflated it, and let it sit for a day, running the pump a couple times to make up for stretching. I slept on it one night, and deflated it. I stored it for a few months, and got it out to use it again. This time it wouldn&rsquo;t hold air for an hour. I have been meticulous about caring for this item, and this isn&rsquo;t acceptable. Previous to this I had a cheap mattress from a department store that lasted years. This mattress appears to be leaking out through the pump/valve. I don&rsquo;t recommend purchasing this product at any price. Your time is too valuable to deal with junk like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-waste-of-money">A waste of money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Horrible bed. Put air in it as soon as I got it and not even 20 mins later it’s like it has a slow leak. Very low to the ground and uncomfortable for me to sleep. It’s definitely not worth the price at all. Intex is just a horrible brand. Will never purchase anything from them again</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="two-stars">Two Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>start leaking after a couple of weeks??? the seams hole from inflation.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broke-after-a-few-uses">Broke after a few uses</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought a total of 3 of these, they all have leaks. I would be glad to send them back for replacements.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect bed!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Awesome product</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-comfortable-but-it-s-not-the-floor">Not comfortable but it’s not the floor.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think the bed is good for temporary usage but long term is no good. Not that comfortable either. I wouldn’t recommend.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-good">No good!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The air bed was dry rotted split down on both sides 3 days after purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Comfortable, inflated reasonably quick and didn&rsquo;t lose air.. it&rsquo;s rather big but I now bring it with me when going to stay at someone&rsquo;s house. Considering buying another one</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="used-twice-1st-time-was-as-indicated">used twice&hellip; 1st time was as indicated &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>used twice&hellip; 1st time was as indicated. 2nd time&hellip;deflated within 3hrs. Mattress flat. Followed manufacturers directions precisely. looking for another option</p>
