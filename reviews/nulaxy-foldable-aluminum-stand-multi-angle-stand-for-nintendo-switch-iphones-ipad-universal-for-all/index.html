<h5 id="nintendo-switch-charge-port-location-got-you-down-edited-to-address-switch-vent-hole-issues">Nintendo Switch charge port location got you down? <strong>Edited to address switch vent hole issues</strong></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This stand will take care of your charge &amp; play needs. This is a very sturdy well machined and assembled adjustable stand. There are little felt feet on the bottom to keep the base from scratching up whatever surface you use it on. I use mine to play (and charge) my Switch since the good folks at Nintendo made that task impossible with the usb-c connector location and included kick stand. I&rsquo;m able to take it with me wherever I go since it can fold up into itself so well, which is a huge plus considering one of the main selling points of the Switch is portability when you need it.EDIT: This stand does in fact cover a very small amount of the switches rear intake / ventilation slots but I&rsquo;d like to note that this has had NO EFFECT on the switches heat dissipation performance. To give an example I used this stand to play Breath of the Wild while charging for a 4 hour session with no thermal issues at all. The system&rsquo;s fan didn&rsquo;t even ramp up once. I&rsquo;m not sure why this is being blown out of proportion the way it is but I can assure you this stand does not create any cooling issues.</p>

<h5 id="get-this-for-you-nintendo-switch">Get this for you Nintendo Switch.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you a have a Switch, buy this stand. Friction lock hinges are nice and right out of the box, the black color ties in with the switch&rsquo;s color well. Using this to almost totally replace the Switch Dock and it&rsquo;s a MUCH more safe feeling stand than the plastic one on the Switch itself. Also gets to screen a couple inches closer to your face which helps with such a small screen size. Also the tablet gripping rubber feet fit the width of the Switch PERFECTLY.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An elegant and sturdy stand, which works perfectly for my iPad Air and my families’ iPhone,such as iPhone <sup>6</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> or plus. It is fully adjustable with the hinge on the top and i can choose the most comfortable angle for viewing. Also, the base is wide and stable as there are four silicone pads on the bottom. Unlike other stands, this stand is totally foldable and easy to carry around.Overall everything is as described and i’m very satisfied with this purchase! Highly recommend!</p>

<h5 id="what-s-not-to-like-it-s-sturdy">What&rsquo;s not to like? It&rsquo;s sturdy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s not to like? It&rsquo;s sturdy, it&rsquo;s foldable. This is bigger than I expected but I can finally adjust the height, which is a plus compared to one that isn&rsquo;t foldable.</p>

<h5 id="just-what-i-needed-for-my-devices">Just what I needed for my devices!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>In love with this thing! Ok maybe not in love literally but yes is an amazing stand and just what I needed for my iPad Air 2 and my iPhone 7 Plus&hellip; it&rsquo;s even great for my kindle paperwhite&hellip; basically for any cellphone or tablet and yes even the Nintendo switch.It&rsquo;s very sturdy, very well constructed. I&rsquo;m never afraid that the stand will break or drop my device. It has some &ldquo;foam stickers&rdquo; on the bottom so that it doesn&rsquo;t move or slide from your desk or table.I don&rsquo;t know what else to tell you. I remembered another thing I liked is that it fits my iPhone and iPad with a case on. So I don&rsquo;t have to remove it from its respective cases to fit them in the stand.I know there are many stands out there like this one&hellip; but I have to say that the quality of this stand is fantastic, great material, very sturdy, non-slippery, it folds completely for portability, and you can adjust the viewing angle to your liking.If this review helped you please click yes and if you have any questions comment down below!Thank you!</p>

<h5 id="excellent-quality-design-for-iphone-and-ipad">EXCELLENT QUALITY DESIGN FOR IPHONE AND IPAD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice&hellip; this foldable iPhone or iPad stand is super well made and I have bought a ton of different stands (both portable and other). I haven&rsquo;t really had the need for a great portable stand until last week. I have a 12.9&rdquo; iPad and it&rsquo;s a large device that can often be hard to depend upon the built in folio stand on my case. This stand is perfect for my iPhone plus; but it&rsquo;s also sturdy enough for my iPad. I am always concerned about scratching my gear and I wasn&rsquo;t sure if a small stand this strong would also be void of sharp edges or design issues. But this is a great choice for an office desk or bedside table. I have only been using this item for a short time; so if something negative shows up I will update my review. But this stand is worth the $20 price which is a bargain for this quality aluminum (thick and tight) stand. Definitely a great gift for anyone (because I think that everyone has at least one smart thing&hellip;.)&hellip; seriously I would highly recommended this for anyone who is in need of a small stand for your precious phone or tablet.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-this-stand-i-m-a-happy-customer">I love this stand! I&rsquo;m a happy customer!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Let me tell you, I absolutely love this stand.It is nice and sturdy. Made of heavy weight material.I love that you can bend it to different angles. Any device can be set on this stand. I have used it for my phone, kindle and iPad. It folds so you can pack it in your bag comfortably.This is one of my favorite purchases.I will be buying a 2nd one for my desk at work to stand my phone on when charging and my Kindle on when reading at lunch. No more holding it the whole time. :)</p>

<h5 id="fantastic-stand-for-a-nintendo-switch-totally-recommended">Fantastic stand for a Nintendo Switch. Totally recommended.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got this one the other day and absolutely love it.Pros: It&rsquo;s heavy enough not to tip over, holds the Switch snug, has very firm hinges, folds down very compact (fits inside my Switch case), gives access to the USB-C and is fairly cheap for the build quality.Cons: Blocks about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> of the vent on the back of the back, but it doesn&rsquo;t seem to cause any overheating. The fan never ramps up and it doesn&rsquo;t seem to get any hotter than when in the dock.</p>

<p>Good resistance for changing position. Sturdy design and functionality. I like the inclusion of the four grips on the bottom of the device, although I am worried about their long&hellip;</p>
