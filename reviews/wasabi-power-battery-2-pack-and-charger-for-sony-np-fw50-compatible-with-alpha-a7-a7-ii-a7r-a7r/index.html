<h5 id="great-wasabi-power-batteries-for-my-sony-a6000">great Wasabi Power Batteries for my Sony A6000</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this after reading the many reviews written by others, and on another battery+charger for my Sony A6000. I was very hesitant due to some poor reviews citing battery discharging even when not used, etc. I got the order quickly and tested them right off. After using and charging them for a few days, I was content enough about their functioning well and in gusty cold condition even, that I put aside the original batteries purchased when I got my A6000 (1 Sony original and a ProMaster generic). These batteries charge slightly faster in the charger and maintain their battery use levels as well as the originals I had purchased. I am truly happy. At one point of a busy shoot day, the battery lasted over four hours of shooting, camera on/off constantly, and even a few flash pixs, and still had a bit of juice remaining! That would not be the case as compared to the original batteries, all dying within two hours no matter what, and even LESS in cold weather. I am indeed happy with these and appreciate the honest truthful reviews written by others enabling me to make an intelligent decision!</p>

<h5 id="great-price-for-2-batteries-and-a-charger">Great price for 2 batteries and a charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great price for 2 batteries and a charger.However, I would not buy again. Frequently when I insert these Wasabi batteries into my camera it gives me an error saying something along the lines of &ldquo;Incompatible battery. Please insert correct battery.&rdquo; It works after a few times but why even risk it? It would certainly cause you to miss some shots if you try to turn the camera on right away and try to take a photo and it gives you that error.I wouldn&rsquo;t get it again.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="larger-capacity-than-stock-batteries-and-a-great-package">Larger capacity than stock batteries and a great package!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The charger is small and uses micro USB to charge so I can use the same charger that came with my Sony a6300 camera. The batteries have more capacity than the stock sony batteries coming in at 1300mAh. I think it might even run cooler than the stock battery as I&rsquo;ve had better run time recording in 4k with my sony a6300 using these batteries. It&rsquo;s also very helpful to have a total of 3 batteries so I can swap them frequently to keep the a6300 cooler while recording 4k. Charger also works for the sony stock battery. This is a great little package and I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="beware-this-battery-will-let-you-down">Beware! This Battery will let you down.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste your money. This is not comparable to the Sony Battery it is purported to replace. I own 2 of the Sony and 2 of the Wasabi Power models. The Sony will easily last an entire day (300+ photos) in my Sony A7Rii. The Wasabi won&rsquo;t make it until lunch. More than once I have been shooting and have gotten the, &ldquo;Battery Exhausted&rdquo; warning with this battery. The included Wasabi Charger is decent enough but there are better models out there. If you do not want to be disappointed at a critical moment in your photographic day, stick with the Sony OEM Battery.</p>

<h5 id="great-product-excellent-customer-support">Great Product, Excellent Customer Support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a landscape and nature photographer most of the time I&rsquo;m shooting outside hiking and backpacking to remote locations, and so I chose this particular version because of the USB powered charger. I usually have at least a battery pack on me, but for longer backpacking and car camping trips I also have solar chargers with me. So with this charger I&rsquo;ll be able to keep the batteries for my Sony a6000 charged for any length of trip, since I live in an area with lots of sun most of the year. For road tripping I can also use my USB charger adaptor which fits into the lighter socket of my car. I also liked the slightly different design of the charger, which holds the batteries upright. I find it&rsquo;s just a little quicker and easier to swap batteries in and out than my other chargers where the batteries lay flat. This is the first Wasabi Charger that I&rsquo;ve seen with a USB cord, it&rsquo;s brilliant for outdoor and travel photographers to be able to charge up easily in the field, and I hope they come out with USB powered chargers for my other cameras too.I have bought several Wasabi Charger Battery packs and always been very happy with them. This is the first time that I have had any kind of problem, and it was a minor one at that. The customer service I received from Blue Nook was stellar! After replying to their email supplying the details they needed so that they could replace the correct part they replied in less than 24 hours saying they were shipping out a replacement. I received it within 72 hours of replying to their email. I am very happy with both the product and customer service.</p>

<h5 id="always-good-to-have-extras">Always good to have extras!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were purchased for my Sony A6000 as backups. You can never have enough batteries in your camera case. This was very reasonably priced as I was able to get two batteries, charger and dc cord for the price of less than one oem battery. I have used both these and my sony oem battery and I can honestly say I can not see a difference in run times. They are both solid batteries and the charger is of a similar build. There is nothing that I found flimsy or indicative they will not withstand the long run. Unless they die prematurely, I give them a five star rating. No negatives to report at this time. Great bang for the buck if you need some extra juice.</p>

<h5 id="a-great-alternative-to-oem-from-a-professional-wedding-photographer">A great alternative to OEM - from a professional wedding photographer.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased about 10 Wasabi brand batteries for my Canon 5DII &amp; 5DIII cameras and now about 10 for my Sony A7R II. (this Sony eats batteries for wedding photography!!) And I have had about 80% of the performance level of the name brand batteries at 20% of the cost of OEM.In the last batch of 4 batteries I purchased 1 was defective and Wasabi was quick to ship me a new one. They stand behind their product - A+ Customer Service!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-battery-package-for-sony-a6000">Amazing Battery Package for Sony a6000</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After doing a lot of research and debating whether to purchase the Sony branded charger/extra batteries, I risked getting the Wasabi Power pack despite some reviews indicating the battery indicator would not show up on the screen. To my pleasant surprise, when I tested a Wasabi spare battery in my Sony a6000, the battery indicator was there! Also, cannot beat the price with 2 spare batteries, a really helpful plug-in charger, European adaptor, and car charger! Does what I need it to do and came at a really great price!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="battery-lasted-1h36min-see-pics-of-my-test-below">Battery lasted 1h36min. See pics of my test below.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t personally buy the battery, but my buddy just did so I did a quick test to see how long the battery lasts.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>They work just fine, as well as the OEM batteries in my experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesn-t-work">Doesn&rsquo;t work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Plug in charger. Lights flash green, then red, then go out. Don&rsquo;t light up when battery inserted. Doesn&rsquo;t charge anything.</p>

<h5 id="missing">Missing?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have used the Wasabi offerings in several other Cameras with very good results&hellip;..this would have gotten get 5 stars had the power port option been included.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-backups-they-may-drain-a-tad-faster-than">Great backups! They may drain a tad faster than &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Can’t beat these for the price! Great backups! They may drain a tad faster than the Sony brand&hellip;but these are a fraction of a price!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="do-not-work-for-sony-false-advertising">DO NOT WORK FOR SONY - FALSE ADVERTISING</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These do not work for Sony a6000 - camera rejects the batteries. I want a full refund please! Scam</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-wasabi-batteries">Love Wasabi Batteries!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wasabi is the only brand of non Sony cameras I will use in my Sony&rsquo;s. They are just as good as the Sony made batteries, if not actually better. Crazy how that works!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="too-bad-quality-i-would-not-buy-again">Too Bad quality, I would not buy again</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Too Bad quality, I would not buy again, it&rsquo;s waste my money. This is not comparable to the Sony Battery.Why amazon sold so bad Battery？</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-dual-charger-is-fantastic">The dual charger is fantastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries last just as long as the factory battery. The dual charger is fantastic!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-buy">Don&rsquo;t Buy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Cheap copies of a quality battery. Will not hold a charge and takes hours to recharge. The original batter that came with my Sony a7RIIis wonderful, nothing like this bad&hellip;</p>
