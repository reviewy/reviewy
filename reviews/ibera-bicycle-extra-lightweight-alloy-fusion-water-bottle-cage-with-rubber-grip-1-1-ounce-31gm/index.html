<p>The ultra thin and sleek bottle cage is the newest member of Ibera&rsquo;s extra lightweight line of bottle cages, weighing only 31g (1.1 oz.), constructed from lightweight heat-treated aluminum alloy. Other bottle cages usually weigh 40g to 70g. The bottle cage is light, but still has the strength of a regular bottle cage.</p>

<p>Great for rides around town or for touring. At only 31 grams, it is perfect for those who want a stylish cage to lighten their load as they ride.</p>

<h5 id="bottle-cage-and-so-far-they-have-both-been-great-it-includes-the-screws-to-attach-it-to">&hellip; bottle cage and so far they have both been great! It includes the screws to attach it to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was my first Ibera bottle cage and so far they have both been great! It includes the screws to attach it to the bike and the screw holes are slightly elongated to allow for various bike tolerances. For this cage I was not as concerned with weight as I was for my road bike but having it so light is always a plus. It is even lighter than some of the carbon frames and significantly cheaper. They have lasted well for me so far and I have even had some friends get them after seeing mine. And the blue pattern matched my Trek perfectly. If you really have the Carbon look fever you can get one that has a carbon fiber pattern. (It will not be made from carbon but will look the part) This exact product is in the picture with the white and blue while the red and white is a similar product from the same brand that I put on my carbon road bike. I find the alloy cages mixed with the rubber attachment in the middle to work the best. They do a great job of adjusting to various bottle shapes and don&rsquo;t alloy the bottle to slide around at all. I did not receive any type of compensation for these products or this review. Let me know if this helped you guys out! Happy riding</p>

<h5 id="works-wonderfully-on-my-crutches-at-least">Works wonderfully (on my crutches at least)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Wonderful product. It&rsquo;s light, cheap, looks great on my bike, and holds my water bottle very snug. But not too tight that its tough to get out or ruin my water bottle. Also I got this water bottle with it and it fits perfectly! Its a great water bottle, and I love the mouthpiece on it CamelBak Podium Water Bottle, 24 oz, Clear Blue You can see the setup in my picture.Unfortunately I broke my leg before I put it on my bike, so now its on my crutches. I now no longer have to ask my coworkers to grab me water every hour (Thank you Cindy!). I can&rsquo;t carry much with me, but this holder and water bottle and follow me around everywhere.I would buy this for every bike I will own.Once I recover I will put this on my bike. I&rsquo;ll update the review if the performance changes when in use on the bike.</p>

<h5 id="good-price-the-green-matches-the-colors-on-my">Good price, the green matches the colors on my &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good price, the green matches the colors on my bike. I use it to hold a large insulated Camelbak water bottle and it has held it without problem for well over 100 miles now. I like that it&rsquo;s aluminum rather than plastic, might not be the lightest if you&rsquo;re a person that counts grams, but I don&rsquo;t and would rather have something sturdy that will last. Just ordered an all black one to add to another bike. Can&rsquo;t beat it for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-tight-with-a-standard-size-bottle-the-rubber-spanner-came-off">Very Tight with a Standard Size Bottle. The Rubber Spanner Came Off.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I thought the rubber spanner on this bottle holder would make it more flexible with different size bottles. Wrong. My 22 oz. Camelback bottle barely squeezed into the holder. Before that, I managed to get my 32 oz. Camelback in it. But, the spanner came off one end of the holder when I pulled the bottle out. Also, the way this holder is designed, it sits too far up either seat post or the bottom bar of the bike.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="securely-holds-24-oz-bottles">Securely holds 24 oz. bottles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently bought a Raleigh Tokul 2 and needed a bottle cage. This one matched the bike&rsquo;s color scheme. Installation was simple of course. While the cage itself is plastic and not adjustable, the base plate is aluminum and can be bent so the tab can engage your particular bottle. I use Polar insulated 24 oz. bottles so I only needed to bend it slightly. I&rsquo;ve ridden with it twice now over pretty rough terrain and the bottle hasn&rsquo;t shown the slightest sign of popping out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-finish-also-came-off-in-the-same-race-and-the-thing-looked-like-it-was-years-old">The finish also came off in the same race and the thing looked like it was years old</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used for one 100 mile race and it failed. Two different areas bent simply from vibration and the bottle would not stay secure anymore. The finish also came off in the same race and the thing looked like it was years old. I will say it could work fine on a road bike or for casual trail riding that is less demanding but It definitely doesn&rsquo;t hold up under the stress of mountain bike racing.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-product-delivery-on-the-spot">Nice product, delivery on the spot</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks great, it is light &amp; very good quality, but the grip is a little too tight on the bottle.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-another-ibera-aluminum-bottle-cage-that-worked-great-i-got-this-one-to-match-the-color">I have another Ibera aluminum bottle cage that worked great. I got this one to match the color &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have another Ibera aluminum bottle cage that worked great. I got this one to match the color scheme of a new bike. This cage is thinner and bends quite easily under just the weight of a full Camelbak 25 OZ Podium Chill bottle. If I hit a rough spot in the road I have noticed the bottles trying to escape. The thicker one here is the one I have on my other bike and works great with the same bottles. <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0030O907C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_25">https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0030O907C/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_25</a></p>
