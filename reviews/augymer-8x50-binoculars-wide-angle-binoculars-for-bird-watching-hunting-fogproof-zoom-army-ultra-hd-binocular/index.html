<h5 id="binoculars">binoculars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Augymer 20x50 wide angle binoculars are a well made set of fogproof binoculars. They are easy to use and easy to focus.The lenses are crystal clear and have a great view. The are durable and nicely patterned in camouflage. They come with a nice carrying case to safely and securely hold them. These binoculars would be great for hunting, camping, hiking or traveling. They also come with two lens covers and two eyepiece covers. There is a rubberized finish to the binoculars that make them easy to grip and they will not slip out of your hands. They are a great set of binoculars for a variety of situations.</p>

<h5 id="have-no-real-knowledge-about-good-or-bad-quality-binoculars">Have no real knowledge about good or bad quality binoculars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Have no real knowledge about good or bad quality binoculars. Usually only had cheap stuff that was difficult to focus. Started to get into bird watching and feeders in back yard and such. Started looking for a less cheap but not mortgage the house quality, thought these would be a good start. I got these and my wife used the cheap free pair we got when buying a vacuum cleaner. Well, now just ordered a pair for my wife. Really like the eyepiece adjustment for viewing with or without glasses</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-good-for-their-price">Pretty good for their price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There is really no need to get binoculars that cost 5 times (or more) for casual use. These work just fine and I&rsquo;ve owned one for a couple of years. If you get any higher magnification than 10X, they are difficult to handhold - so 7-8X is really the sweet spot as far as magnification goes. The other number refers to the exit aperture (bigger the number - more light gets into the binocular). These also work quite well in darker situations - letting in plenty of light and giving you a bright image. I&rsquo;ve noted small differences when compared with an Olympus that cost about 8 times more - but really, for their price, these can&rsquo;t be beat..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-seem-like-100-200-binoculars">They seem like $100-200 binoculars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these because I go camping and wanted to be able to take a quick peak around every once in a while. They seemed very quality for the price, and they are absolutely that! I was so impressed. They seem like $100-200 binoculars. My brother had a cool looking pair, and when he looked in these he was amazed. Don&rsquo;t hesitate, just buy these. If your skeptical about the price, you can pretend like your spending more, because you will feel that way when they arrive! They come with a carrying case, and a neck strap. 5 stars A+++</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-recommend-these">I recommend these.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are just right for me. I am not hunting, so early morning and dusk situations aren&rsquo;t critical. I just camp and hike and sometimes need to see a ways away. I have used Zeiss and Swarovski and many others and these aren&rsquo;t them but for $17.00 Lightening Deal, I would buy these again if I needed some. They come with case, cloth and lens caps. They are full size Binoculars so you don&rsquo;t want to walk around with these on your neck all day. I recommend these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-binoculars">great binoculars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just recently returned from a trip to Alaska. I bought these before I left. Having purchased them at the last moment, online without ever seeing them, and for such a great price&hellip;I didn&rsquo;t have very high expectations. But they worked so great for us! They were so easy to focus and great at long distances. I&rsquo;m very satisfied that I chose these binoculars!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="high-quality-binoculars-for-a-reasonable-price">High quality Binoculars for a reasonable price! :)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ended up purchasing these binoculars because of the low price. After some research, I found that the specs on these binoculars would do so I gave them a shot and received them. I really like that it came in a pouch with lens caps on both ends to protect the lenses from scratches and dust which is a huge plus and that you can also attach it to a tripod is mind blowing for stargazing! :D Would have been great if they were available in other colors such as black. :)</p>

<p>I read some good reviews, however I was not happy with them, I knew they were not going to be the best pair due to the low price, but I was expecting to at least see out of them.</p>
