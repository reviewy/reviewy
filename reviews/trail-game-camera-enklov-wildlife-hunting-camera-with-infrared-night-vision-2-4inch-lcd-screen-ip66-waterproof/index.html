<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="good">good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camera has some good features and produces good quality video and pictures.It is 12-mega pixel, no glow, infrared game camera with a quick trigger and HD video mode.The trail camera can stand up to the elements of rain, snow, sun, and wind. It’s trigger speed, at 0.7 seconds, is extremely rapid.The interval between the time the wildlife comes into a trail camera’s field of view is very short.The camera takes the footage with absolutely no visible light ( to us or the animals) so they are not disturbed. Brilliant! Images at night are monochrome at night of course but in full colour in daylight.Very pleased with this product.Would defiantly recommend!</p>

<p>I had a telescope before but that one&rsquo;s image was very blurry. When I got this new one I was so excited to take it a try. Wow, it surprised me how good the quality it is. The image is clear and sharp and the range is pretty wide. Good for bird watching. And it comes with a cloth, a bag and a supporting triangle and easy to use.</p>
