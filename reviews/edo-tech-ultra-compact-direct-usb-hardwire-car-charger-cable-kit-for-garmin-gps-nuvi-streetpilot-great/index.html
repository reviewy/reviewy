<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="not-compatible-with-traffic-reciever-models">Not compatible with Traffic Reciever models.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Although not clear in the photo, the power supply box is about 15&rdquo; from the 12v / 24v power supply lead. The USB cable is longer, which makes installation of the box in a concealed location easier. The downside is this is NOT compatible with Garmin traffic receiver models. It will supply power, but the traffic receiver feature will not operate. Two versions of the Garmin traffic receiver models are both identified LMT on the package. One version uses a separate traffic power supply cable, identified by a double cord. These models do not have a T suffix in the model ID on the back of the GPS unit, ex nuvi 2555LM or nuvi 2595LM. The other version uses an internal receiver and the Garmin single round USB cord - these models are identified with a T in the model suffix on the back of the GPS unit, ex. nuvi 2595LMT.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="may-not-function-properly-with-garmin-units-with-traffic-option">May Not Function Properly With Garmin Units with Traffic Option</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>FYI&hellip;.Be aware that this does not work with a Nuvi 2597LMT. It may not work with anyGarmin Nuvi that has the Traffic option, even if you have it turned OFF. Unit seems torecognize that the cable is not a Garmin cable and will keep informing you of it over andover again. Called Garmin Customer Service about it and they verified that this cable willnot work with the Nuvi 2597LMT.If you have a Garmin without Traffic, it will probably work fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="second-review">Second review</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first device worked fine for a couple of weeks - long enough for me to trust it and have it professionally wired into my touring motorcycle. It then worked fine for a week or so more, then it started sporadically shutting off. Wrote a scathing review, next thing I know I got a new one in the mail. The problem with the first one was the connection into the back of the GPS was not good. The new one works fine and I was impressed with the speed and response of the company when they read my first review. I had written it off, but they took the initiative - what customer service should be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-with-garmin-dash-cam-20-too">Works with Garmin Dash Cam 20, too!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it for the intent of hardwiring my Garmin Dash Cam 20 to my car. Works great. The one thing I wish was that the USB cord is a little longer. I ran the cord along the edge of the roof and down along the door&rsquo;s edge. The little box is now hanging just above the dash. If the cord is a little longer, I could have put this little black box below the dash, making it looks a little better.I did also have to extend the wires (positive and negative) on the other end since they&rsquo;re a little short there, too.Other than the short cord/wire issue, it works great. Originally I contacted an installer and they wanted $120 for 2 hours of installation. I did this in less than about 1 hour with a $14 part and some $10 for extra wires and electrical tape. :-)</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-and-works-great">Easy to install and works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to install and works great. Helps get rid of of some external wiring from my aux plug</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-for-a-week-then-broke">Worked for a week, then broke.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was installed onto a 2013 BMW r1200rt. I spent a good time unhooken all the tupperware off of my bike to get this installed. Once installed, worked like a charm. My Garmin GPS booted up (and didnt goto &ldquo;PC CONNECT&rdquo; like many other aftermarket chargers) and was ready to go. The problems arose 1 week in tho. My GPS started to lose power all of a sudden. When i unplugged it, the miniUSB part snapped in half?I&rsquo;ve not had this problem with my regular garmin adapter hooked up to powerlet, so i was surprised it broke so easily. Tried emailing EDO Tech but i havent heard back from them. I eventually just spliced a different Mini USB to it, but i get the PC Connect message now. Despite it semi-working, i cant really recommend this product; it doesnt feel rugged enough for motorcycle use.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="intermittent-power">Intermittent power</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great for a few months then GPS started to loose external power and then the count down. Sometimes power came back on before the end of the count down and others it would turn completely off and then turn back on after a few seconds to a minute&hellip; Would have to push the button to keep it going while there was no power going through the cable according to the GPS and it would run on battery until the power returned. Seems to be getting worse and I bet after another month I won&rsquo;t have power at all. I am looking for a replacement now&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-kit">Nice little kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth the money to wire up my GPS professionally rather than have a coil cord strung across the dash. Nice little kit.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="let-s-see-what-happens-next">Let&rsquo;s see what happens next</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This will be my second wire ordered. The first one at the neckline is causing a power cut out. I&rsquo;m going to try another one and see if I have the same problem. 😩</p>
