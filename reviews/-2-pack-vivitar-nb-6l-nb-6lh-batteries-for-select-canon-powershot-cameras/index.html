<h5 id="the-batteries-held-a-charge-well-until-they-had-been">The batteries held a charge well until they had been &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The batteries held a charge well until they had been recharged several times. After a couple dozen recharges they die very quickly.UPDATE on 31AUG2017:I was contacted about my experience earlier this month and the company sent me one replacement battery. After fully charging the battery, I inserted it into my camera and left my camera overnight on my dining room table. I took it out birding the next afternoon. Once I had taken 10 photos and two short videos (under a minute each) the battery life indicator on my camera started blinking red and shut down. The camera was turned off in between use and I had only been birding for 24 minutes at this point. Toward the end of my hike I tried to turn the camera on and it started up with a full battery icon.I have two other brands of batteries and neither of those behave this way. I highly recommend avoiding these batteries.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-seller-great-cleaning-kit-horrible-batteries">Great seller, Great cleaning kit, HORRIBLE Batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, I have to say the seller of these was great. The seller deserves 5 stars without a doubt. The cleaning kit was also great, and that also deserves 5 stars. However, the batteries, which was the main reason for buying this, they don&rsquo;t even deserve 1 star. I received 2 of them, 1 worked and one didn&rsquo;t. I contacted the seller, and they sent a replacement to me ASAP. Unfortunately, that one as defective too. So 2 out of 3 batteries were bad right out of the box. I would NOT recommend these Vivitar batteries at all, which is unfortunate as I&rsquo;ve had other Vivitar products in the past and always liked them, so it must just be these batteries that are bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-vendor-good-batteries">Excellent vendor, good batteries.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kit was OK, but one of the two Vivitar batteries I bought would not hold a charge. I have several different brands of the NB-6L batteries (including an OEM Canon), but I&rsquo;ve never had a problem with ANY of them except this Vivitar. I would not buy them again.UPDATE: I&rsquo;m updating my review to five stars. The vendor had seen my initial 1-star poor review and offered to replace the bad battery. The replacement works well. So, the vendor was excellent, and the batteries work fine. I would buy these again based on this experience. I want the vendor to know that I appreciate them going the extra mile for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-the-same-as-they-were-in-the-past">Not the same as they were in the past.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ehhh, that&rsquo;s really what I have to say about these. I bought a Canon SX700HS open-box from Best Buy at a great price, but it came without a charger or a battery, and since I gave my mom my old SX700HS, I had no NB-6LHs or NB-6Ls anymore. I have Vivitar NB-5Ls for my S110 and NB-10Ls for my SX50, and I&rsquo;ve also bought the NB-6LHs before, for the old SX700HS. These, however, are not up to par. They seemed to drain really quickly and I could barely get 100 shots each, without flash, using the same settings, not adjusting zoom, or anything, mostly taken in succession, when I used to easily be able to get 300+ shots. I know I can do that with the NB-5L, and that is a similarly-sized battery. This is supposed to be a 1700 mAh battery, but it&rsquo;s not performing like it.I had to return the SX700HS, because I was comparing to my S110, since I thought the colors were off, and the return period was about to expire (yay open-box and not &ldquo;ruining&rdquo; a new camera, right? Too bad I couldn&rsquo;t afford to keep it!). Then, right after, I found an open-box S120, YES! That also takes the NB-6LH, and now I know it&rsquo;s the batteries themselves and not the camera draining the batteries, since this camera is eating them even more quickly, which makes sense, since it&rsquo;s a little more power-hungry than an SX700HS in general. Now I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m even getting 100 shots, so I&rsquo;m going to swallow the cost of an OEM Canon&hellip;until I go to my parents&rsquo; house for Thanksgiving in a few weeks and steal back one of 2-3 OEMs that I gave my mom (they live 1400 miles away or I&rsquo;d just go take one from her!).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worth-it-for-the-batteries-alone">Worth it for the batteries alone.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not a photography nut or anything, just a normal user. We bought a new camera, a Canon PowerShot SX510 HS, and it is awesome! Planning on using it alot so I wanted to make sure we don&rsquo;t run out of juice. I bought this kit because it came with 2 batteries for about the same price as just geting a battery on its own.The batteries work great with the camera, and the charger works on both the included batteries, and the OEM battery from Canon. Now we have a home charger and a travel charger. We can even charge batteries in the car!I pretty much ignore the other items. The cleaning cloth is nice and lives in the camera bag, but the brush, spray bottle, and litle bulb thing have been relegated to the junk drawer. I&rsquo;m sure they would get more use from someone who is more invested in photography than we are.Great purchase, but I bought this package just for the batteries. If you can find the batteries alone for cheaper, go that route.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="higher-milliamp-hour-rating-at-a-lower-price">Higher Milliamp Hour Rating At A Lower Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries are rated at 1700 mAh, the original Canon NB-6L battery that came with my camera is rated at 1000 mAh. That is 70% more battery capacity (per battery). My picture taking capacity has greatly increased with these batteries, and I don&rsquo;t suffer from &ldquo;Dead Battery-itis&rdquo; anymore. They are a great value also. Two batteries, a charger and the cleaning accessories cost less than half the price of a Canon branded NB-6L battery alone. The charger is a little chunkier than the charger that Canon supplies, but the Canon charger can not be used to charge batteries with a 12V DC Car Charger.Technical Stuff:Milliamps Hour (mAh) rating is the easiest way to distinguish the strength or capacity of a battery. The mAh rating is an indication of how long a battery will last per charge. The higher the mAh rating, the longer the battery will last before needing to be recharged. Batteries with different mAh ratings are interchangeable.</p>
