Product Description
This tough and ready SLR holster was designed to keep pace with your approach to photography. Rugged styling with a professional grade interior and organization will take you anywhere the shots are waiting.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
SLRC-201 SLR Zoom Holster</p>

<p>This tough and ready SLR Holster was designed for the minimalist traveler who wants to carry their camera with zoom lens attached and a few accessories, but doesn’t need a full-sized case. It is constructed to protect your camera and withstand the wear and tear of your indoor or outdoor adventures. This holster holds most SLR camera bodies up to 6.3 x 4.7 x 6.9&rdquo; with zoom or kit lens attached.</p>

<p>Materials
Only high-quality materials are used throughout this exceptionally crafted SLR Holster, which is backed by a 25 year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. Exterior materials include heavy-gauge (840D) nylon with eye-catching orange accents. The case interior is lined in bright yellow for easy visibility of the contents. Carry options include a padded handle and a removable, padded shoulder strap with swivel hardware.</p>

<p>Hammock System
Hammock System
The innovative hammock system (patent pending) cradles your SLR in a neoprene bed suspended above the bottom of the case, providing superior impact protection. The triangular opening on the neoprene bed accommodates a wide range of lens diameters. When not in use, this optional system detaches and lays flat against the inside of the case.</p>

<p>Molded EVA Base
The semi-rigid, molded EVA base creates a water-resistant foundation to this already rugged SLR holster. Formed of high-density foam, this base adds rigidity and allows the case to stand up on its own.</p>

<p>Molded EVA Base</p>

<p>Memory Foam
Memory Foam
The dense, scratch-resistant memory foam lining the interior lid of the camera compartment cushions and protects your delicate LCD screen.</p>

<p>Accessory Storage
A zippered front pocket is ideal for memory cards, lens cloth or other small items. The mesh pocket inside the front pocket helps organize your accessories.</p>

<p>Zippered Side Pockets
Zippered Side Pockets
Two zippered side pockets store an extra battery, charger, filters or cables.</p>

<p>Carrying Options
This case provides two carrying options. The padded carry handle on top allows you to grab and go. The removable, padded shoulder strap can be adjusted to your preferred length. Swivel hardware on the shoulder strap lets the bag move with you when changing shoulders or transitioning to wearing across the body.</p>

<h5 id="and-i-truly-enjoy-it-it-is-fairly-small-and-has-several">and I truly enjoy it! It is fairly small and has several &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted a small &amp; protective camera case for my Nikon D3400 because I was getting sick of using my gigantic cross body camera bag for carrying one small camera or tossing my camera in my backpack hoping it won&rsquo;t break. After several hours of researching, I I ended up with this camera case. I&rsquo;ve been using it for couple months already, and I truly enjoy it!It is fairly small and has several small compartments that I can store the battery charger, car key, and wireless mobile adapter. I try not to carry too much in this bag because those compartments are really small and can only fit small items. One thing I don&rsquo;t like about the bag is the oddly shaped body. It&rsquo;s a trapezoidal block, not a rectangular block, so I don&rsquo;t love the shape. But it serves the purpose of protecting my camera while being small, so I recommend it! :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-case-for-a-panasonic-dmc-fz70-bridge-camera">Good case for a Panasonic DMC FZ70 &ldquo;bridge&rdquo; camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case is well built and very light weight. I like the hard bottom that prevents the case from wicking up any moisture. The three side pockets are adequate to hold cords, filters, and a battery charger.The hammock supports the camera very well, but I have a wide neck strap that I have to put into the case first, under the hammock, else it sits on the back of the camera and could scratch the LCD monitor. This case is excellent for cameras with fixed lens, also.I originally ordered the case (DCB-304) which was recommended for my camera by Amazon, but it was too small to accommodate the accessories.</p>

<h5 id="great-bag-when-you-just-want-to-carry-the-camera">Great bag when you just want to carry the camera &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great bag when you just want to carry the camera + small accessories. I have a Nikon D5200 with a Tamron 70-300 and it fits (snuggly) but it fits. The bag has 2 side and 1 front pockets (all with zippers). What i liked: (a) Could fit my camera and lens (the 70-300 is a bit bulky), (b) Very light, &copy; Good padding at the top and bottom, (d) The base is semi-rigid and sounds like fair protection (shock + moisture).The price was barely higher than other bags in its range so I opted for this one.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-fit">Perfect fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very pleased that I went with this case. The camera fits securely and well protected. I went with this model because I only needed a case for my camera (Canon Rebel T7i with shoulder strap), and for me it was a smart choice since I don&rsquo;t have any accessories and only one lens, 18-155mm. I needed a case to carry the camera in for when we&rsquo;re on the go and to keep it stored when not in use. I was able to fit the battery charger with no problem but this charger doesn&rsquo;t have a cord. You can also fit extra batteries and sd cards. It looks to be very well made except maybe the clips on the straps, they&rsquo;re plastic, but for what I need it for it should work just fine. Can&rsquo;t beat the price either, I saw it for 50 bucks at BestBuy. Gotta love Amazon.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-case-great-padding">Solid case, great padding</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If there was a 4.5 stars I&rsquo;d use that, but I have to round down slightly..First, this is a great, solid case. The &ldquo;hammock suspension&rdquo; is basically a neoprene type sling at the top with a hole for the lens. It&rsquo;s well designed and holds my trusty Canon T3i very securely, whether with the 18-55 kit lens or with the 55-250 zoom. Yes, it most definitely fits the zoom lens.Zippers seem solid enough, will be putting it to the test on a trip next month, the strap attaches securely, and the high-visibility interior color means it&rsquo;s hard to lose things in any of the pockets. Speaking of pockets, they&rsquo;re all pretty tiny. Plenty big enough for a filter kit, SD cards, spare batteries, etc&hellip; but don&rsquo;t plan to pack chargers and such in this bag. That&rsquo;s just not what it&rsquo;s for.The two drawbacks for me that led to less than 5 stars are room for an attached camera strap and overall weight. First, I have a strap attached to me T3i. Stuff happens, I&rsquo;d rather not drop it. Trying to get the Camera in with the strap attached and not having it pressed against the exposed LCD requires some beginner origami; it&rsquo;s do-able, I just wish the foam that does such a great job of holding the camera in and protecting the LCD had a recess on each side to give some extra room to tuck the strap into.Second, this case is beefy. That&rsquo;s both a good and a bad thing - I really like the excellent level of protection it provides, but part of me is wondering if I need that much due to the tradeoff of some weight. and bulk when trying to fit it into a daypack with this case. But I really didn&rsquo;t want yet another backpack so this is a good tradeoff.I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this case to others - good price, good quality, great protection. If you don&rsquo;t have a strap on your DSLR you&rsquo;ll really appreciate how snugly it holds everything in there&hellip; if you do have a strap, well, you&rsquo;ll manage.</p>

<p>Well designed/engineered. Camera and strap leaves things a bit tight, though. Would be nice if there were a bit more room&ndash;even in the pockets, too&ndash;for filters, etc.</p>
