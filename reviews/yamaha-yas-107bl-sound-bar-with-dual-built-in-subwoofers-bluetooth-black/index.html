<h5 id="great-sounding-soundbar-ever">Great sounding Soundbar ever!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been waiting for Yamaha&rsquo;s new soundbar for a few months now&hellip;because Yamaha&rsquo;s have great reviews with the sound, however it&rsquo;s been a few years since they released a new one. and i&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;ve waited! this soundbar sounds great!! no need for extra subwoofer for my small room. enough bass with built-in subwoofers! highs sound very clear!</p>

<p>i like this sound bar has good sound. it perfect for my setup.</p>

<p>Could use more bass&mdash;should have gotten the unit with the separate sub woofer!!</p>

<h5 id="classy-design-excellent-sound-for-all-but-the-most-avid-audiophiles-great-tv-speaker-replacement">Classy design, excellent sound for all but the most avid audiophiles - great TV speaker replacement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this at Costco - listed as a ATS-1070 model.I walked into Costco the other day - I knew my new 4k UHD HDR tv&rsquo;s speakers were subpar - I wanted a sound bar with as few wires and hassles as possible.Of course, Costco had a display with multiple options and I nearly walked away with a 2.1 system from Samsung that puts out 300W of power. I walked around the store to continue shopping while I deliberated on what was more important?I&rsquo;ve always had an affinity for Yamaha&rsquo;s sound products, from an alto saxophone to a powerful receiver to an electronic piano with weighted keys to motorcycles. Okay, I&rsquo;m a fan. However, when faced with an opportunity for a louder Samsung system. My conviction to buy a Yamaha wavered.Here&rsquo;s what I finally figured out:- Sleekness is important, tired of multiple wires and pieces- Bass is important but not the most important part of the experience- Loudness is good but not all important, I am solving for poor TV audio quality. Okay, when I watch a movie and I want to pump up the noise, its fidelity is not as great as a higher wattage system. That&rsquo;s ok - it serves the primary purpose of improving the sound coming from my TV.As a TV speaker replacement it&rsquo;s great.<sup>107</sup>&frasl;<sub>1070</sub> supports 4K UHD107/1070 supports HDR107/1070 supports ARC (audio return channel) HDMI107/1070 supports Bluetooth 4.<sup>1107</sup>&frasl;<sub>1070</sub> acts like a 5.1 systemAs a music delivery system, it&rsquo;s unbelievably good at this price point.The bass output is enough for most people. At the highest volumes with the bass extension on, there is some shake.The fake-surround sound doesn&rsquo;t sound fake, not one bit.The tweeters, when the speaker is set up shelf top, don&rsquo;t convey the sound nearly as well as it should. Even though I currently have it shelf top though below my TV, I think these speakers only do justice to dialogue when wall mounted.</p>

<p>sounds great</p>

<h5 id="the-bass-isn-t-as-good-as-having-a-separate-sub">The bass isn&rsquo;t as good as having a separate sub</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This sound bar is kick ass. The bass isn&rsquo;t as good as having a separate sub, but it&rsquo;s still good. Audio quality is crystal clear and it gets pretty darn loud. Highly recommended. ARC control via HDMI is very nice. The unit powers on and off with my 40&rdquo; TCL Roku TV and volume is controlled from the TV remote.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sounding-sound-bar">Great sounding sound bar</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sounding sound bar! I live in a studio apartment and it really is perfect for our space. I&rsquo;ve never invested in a sound system for my TV before and am blown away by how much of a difference it makes. The subwoofer does a great job and really fills the room - everything sounds like its surrounding you in surround mode.Only things I&rsquo;m not 100% satisfied with is that there is a tiny bit of lag when controlling the bar with my TV remote. Its great that it automatically turns on/off in sync with my tv, but wish the TV remote was a bit quicker. Also, one thing I&rsquo;ve found annoying &ndash; if the sound bar is on bluetooth is on and connected to my Amazon Echo, and then swtich it to my TV&mdash; the Echo will still think it&rsquo;s connected to the speaker, even though my TV audio is now coming out of it. There&rsquo;s been a few times I&rsquo;ve missed reminders from Alexa because no audio came out after i turned on the tv.Other than that&ndash; really a great bar that does everything I hoped it would!</p>

<h5 id="great-purchase-of-the-year">Great purchase of the year</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a first impression review. I wanted a soundbar for the bedroom that did not have any speakers or wiring on the floor., but still could fill the room with great ,but not wall thumping sound and do my 48 inch LG proud. I had done a lot of research, watched videos on YouTube, compared prices between EBay and Amazon{my favorite shopping place}. And I decided to go with this unit. Easy to install, one plugin to the optical audio and I was ready to go. The remote is simple yet very responsive to the unit, unlike my SH4 LG 2.1 sound bar with wireless sub in the family room. The sound is clear and can get very loud. The bass is thumping but not overbearing, plus the clear-voice feature works fine. The only con is there is no way to adjust the tweeter, otherwise, this is one of my better purchases on Amazon this year, 91 and counting.</p>

<h5 id="returned-due-to-difficult-set-up">Returned due to difficult set up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was disappointed with this sound bar and ended up returning it. The big problem, for me, was that the sound bar wants you to run each of your devices THRU the sound bar - as&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="great-sound">Great sound.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound for the money. I have a YAS-106 and love it. I was looking for another one when I saw this update had come out. I ordered it and could not he happier with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sound-1">Great Sound!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great sound from a nice, reasonably priced soundbar. Solid bass for a soundbar and great spatial sound gives a good approximation of a multi-speaker system.</p>

<h5 id="don-t-forget-to-enable-cec">Don&rsquo;t forget to enable CEC</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great soundbar, for the last year I had just been using captions on everything before I realized that the problem was the TV speakers, not my ears!</p>

<p>Sound is ok. Disappointed that my Samsung J6300 was not able to make use of ARC HDMI connection. Could only connect through optical cable.</p>

<p>Great product, crisp, clean, good bass, lotsa punch. Good seller - prompt delivery and communication. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>This is my 2nd soundbar purchase, the first was a different brand with good ratings that didn&rsquo;t work when I got it. I really like this one, easy set up, sounds great.</p>

<p>Amazing sound - easy installation. Initially used optical audio but switch to HDMI so Samsung TV remote controls Amazon FireTV box and volume on Yamaha soundbar.</p>
