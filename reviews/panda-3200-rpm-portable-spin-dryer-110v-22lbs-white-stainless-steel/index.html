<h5 id="best-spin-dryer-i-ve-found">BEST spin dryer I&rsquo;ve found.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I feel like I am somewhat of an expert on Spin dryers, as I&rsquo;ve had 4 of them. I use them in my business several times a day. 3 were from the Laundry Alternative. The earliest model broke down after about a year, the second model was pretty good and broke down after about 3 years when the bottom was literally rotting out from rust (I was OK with this as I felt I got plenty of use out of it). The third one was their latest, and it was a disaster, the quality was horrible and it didn&rsquo;t last a week. So, as I was desperate, and about ready to lose my mind for lack of a spin dryer which my work flow depends on, I ordered this one.HEAVEN. This is seriously the best spin dryer I have ever used. It is so well made and durable. You have to WORK to make it out of balance. I just throw the fiber I&rsquo;m drying in there and only about 1 out of 10 times is it out of balance, compared to the LA one (which I was happy with at the time). It does not vibrate excessively and is quiet for a spin dryer. And, the best thing is - it has a brake. So, when you turn it off, the spinning stops immediately. Someone pointed it out that maybe this will reduce the lifespan of the dryer. I&rsquo;m impatient and used to stick my hand in the other one to get it to stop (carefully, with a towel on my fingers, so I didn&rsquo;t rip my hand off), so if this reduces the lifespan of this dryer, so be it, better than losing a hand.My only criticism would be that it seems like the outside finish is rusting a little from water droplets. If I cared, I could be more careful about letting the items drip dry or wipe the outside down after a spin. That might be something you should watch for if you get this dryer.I have only had it for about a month now, but I&rsquo;ve probably spun at least 30-40 loads in it.If you are in the market for a spin dryer, spend the extra money and get this one. It&rsquo;s WELL worth it.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="it-is-perfect-to-do-laundry-in-close-spaces">It is perfect to do laundry in close spaces</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> It worked as expected. It is perfect to do laundry in close spaces. We received this little unit well ahead of the promised delivery date. It works very well and I am very happy with the performance. The unit removes enough water to convince me it is saving energy cost as well as wear and tear on the conventional electric dryer. Do NOT use Chlorine bleach unless you wring by hand and then rinse stainless steel will corrode and fall to pieces! I suggest getting a VERY sturdy table and putting a 5 gallon bucket beneath the dryer water spigot. If you have a porch out of the elements this dryer would be best used there. Except for heavy cottons items dry with a fan at room temps in less than 5 minutes after hanging. Towels and t-shirts about an hour on shower rack. I LOVE THIS THING! Very important to press all of the laundry added hard into bottom of dryer to insure balance. LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! I recommend it to anyone wishing to reduce their energy cost as well as the time conventional dryers take to do the same job.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="works-like-a-charm">Works like a CHARM!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> <strong><em>Received in Exchange of Honest Review</em></strong>Video: The attached video shows the spin dryer in action.. Its very quite as you can see from the video and really pulls the water out of the clothes!I live in a smaller apartment that doesn&rsquo;t have washer and dryer hookups so it has a laundry facility.. Most of my clothing is washed in that facility BUT I don&rsquo;t always have time to run down and wash small items like underwear or sometimes even my work clothes! For that I have a mini washing machine (Egg Style), purchased here from Amazon and I just take the clothing outside to dry or use my heated drying rack.. Both work GREAT but slow since my mini washing machine doesn&rsquo;t have a spin cycle! This cuts drying time down to about 45 minutes total!! 5 Mins in the spin dryer and about 40 minutes outside or on the heated drying rack to become 100% dry.. This means drying time is about exactly what a heated dryer would take!Pros1.) Looks VERY NICE - The stainless steel design looks very nice in my home!2.) Very Quite!3.) Holds plenty of clothes - I just tested with my work clothes and there is still plenty of space left4.) Auto Turn Off - The unit runs for about 5 minutes and then turns off5.) Tons of safety features - Lid locks shut, the lock is the &ldquo;Power Button&rdquo; and the drum is locked in place when the lid is open.. Should be very safe in your home6.) Seems to be super high quality7.) Cuts drying time down to under 45 minutes!8.) Very Slim Unit! Can tuck away with ease in a cornerOverall: This spin dryer might not be for everyone but for me it works great.. Its an excellent solution to do small loads in between my trips to the laundry facility here at my apartment.. The looks and design of this spin dryer are great and it works like a charmREAD MORE</p>

<p>Works better than expected. Wrings clothes very dry. The only down side it that it is heavy, but that is because it is very well made. I do like to put it on the counter so the water drains directly into the sink. Great capacity.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="this-is-worth-it">This is worth it!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I highly recommend this product, it is very quiet and it works perfectly fine, mine came without no damages to the product at all and yes it is very true about what other people are saying about the balancing.. Make sure your location is leveled upon were you want it to be.. Other then that I have no problems thus far.. Again I totally recommend this product to anyone who is looking to save money on your laundry needs.READ MORE</p>
