<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="very-low-sound-and-no-volume-control-buttons">Very low sound and no volume control buttons.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have the SoundTouch 300 soundbar and bought the surround speakers to fill out the sound. But they add very little to the listening experience. The audio that comes out is very very low. There is no volume adjustment on the surround speakers. If I had the ability to adjust the sound on the surround speakers myself I would have kept them. But as it is I have to put my ear right next to the speaker to even verify it&rsquo;s working. Most of the time, even when watching movies, hbo, showtime, amc, very little is coming out of the surround speakers. When playing a surround sound test audio you get something, but blu rays, streaming, cable not much. If only there were a volume control on the surround speakers it would be acceptable. Poor speakers, not recommended.</p>

<h5 id="bose-is-a-great-sound-system-company-i-own-the-complete-soundtouch-300">Bose is a great sound system company i own the complete soundtouch 300 &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bose is a great sound system company i own the complete soundtouch 300 system, this is including the soundbar and the brand new acoustimass 300, the sound is great, i use this system to watch tv and for videogames playing.Regarding the looks, it is simply beautiful i know that doesn&rsquo;t have anithing to do with sound quality but looking good never harmed anybody.I recomend the complete system not only the speakers.</p>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE THESE, just with you could increase the volume of the surround sound</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="updated-these-are-worth-buying-now">Updated: These are worth buying now!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Its okay to buy this now, disregard previous bad reviews!!! These are great speakers now.. they used to not be worth buying since the audio that came out of it was so low you would have to put it to your ears in order to hear the sound. I previously didnt buy these because of the bad reviews but then I saw Bose updated their app to fix this. I bought these surround sound speakers earlier today at the Bose store and connected it to my 300 soundbar. They are amazing and definitely worth the $300 price tag now. I mostly listen to music on my system and music is way better with these little speakers.Remember to make sure you UPDATE YOUR SYSTEM VIA SOUNDTOUCH APP. Once its updated there is an option to control the volume of the rear speakers in your setup. I&rsquo;m glad Bose addressed this problem. The lady at the Bose store knew exactly what I was talking about and said several people would return them&hellip; they&rsquo;re good now. I wish Bose updated sooner especially since they should have detected this in product testing but glad their developers fixed it now.</p>

<h5 id="these-are-okay">These are okay.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are okay. I already had the ST 300 and bass module. Figured, what the heck, I&rsquo;ll give these a shot, too. These complete the package, and the sound quality from the whole system is top notch. The three star rating: Honestly, not worth $300. They&rsquo;re bigger than I thought they&rsquo;d be (my fault, I didn&rsquo;t check the dimensions ahead of time). I have another Bose system with smaller speakers than these, so I was expecting something along those lines for the size (the product description even says smallest speakers Bose designs). The actual size is not an issue, but for the bulk of these speakers, I expected the sound to pour out of them like the rest of the system. Nope. I&rsquo;m not getting that &ldquo;full, immersive&rdquo; experience. Even streaming UHD content and action movies is less than stellar.The setup was also not as easy as I expected. I had to manually attach the speaker wire connectors. They included the screwdriver, which was nice. Also had a problem with the soundbar thinking the speakers weren&rsquo;t connected, but they were?? Odd&hellip; Had to reset the whole system, and everything works fine now.UPDATE: Having had these speakers now for a few months (and a few software updates later), the amount of sound coming from the speakers is markedly better than before. The difference isn&rsquo;t life changing, but it&rsquo;s noticeable enough for me to give an update.</p>

<h5 id="average-af-for-the-price-you-pay">Average af for the price you pay</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Extremely difficult to setup. I bought it with the Bose UFS-20 Series II Universal Floor Stands. At first the light on the power brick wasn&rsquo;t coming on for either speakers. After plugging in and out of different outlets, it finally lit up. After that, everything worked smoothly. Definitely don&rsquo;t recommend this equipment as a main speaker, the volume on this is extremely soft. I can barely hear anything coming out unless I put my ear right up against them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-surround-for-the-st300">Good surround for the ST300</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got them along with the sub to complete the ST300 5.1 system. I see a lot of reviews saying they are not loud enough? They sound just right to me for satellite surround speakers. There is speaker wire connected to each one that is around 5-8ft long .. each one connects to a large power adapter that needs to be plugged in. Not exactly wireless but much easier to hide the adapters then having to run speaker wire across a room or feeding through the walls / ceiling. If you want the 5.1 experience for your ST300 entertainment system, they are a must buy! They are worth the extra $300 IMO.</p>

<p>Can not hear from the Bose sound bar.</p>

<h5 id="poor-designed-expensive-and-does-not-sound-good">Poor Designed, Expensive, and Does Not Sound Good.</h5>

<p>Bose has gotten progressively bad with each passing day. These speakers are very poorly designed. The speakers themselves are small but the adapter and power cord are humungous.</p>

<h5 id="sound-bad">sound bad</h5>

<p>First the sound was well but now not, I bought the all home theater of bose and the sound now is not good</p>

<p>These are a great addition the the SoundTouch 300 bar and sub. Some reviews seem to knock these speakers because of their low volume, which I don’t get.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="complete-system">Complete system</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased these after buying the soundtouch 300 soundbar and acoustimass wireless subwoofer. Without the rear speakers, the system did not sound &ldquo;complete.</p>

<h5 id="great-sound">Great Sound!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read through many mixed reviews of these VI300 speakers and the Soundtouch 300 sound bar and frankly my experience has been excellent.</p>

<p>Pair it with the soundbar and acoustimass 300 subwoofer and these little guys turn your room into a movie theater experience.</p>

<h5 id="bose-does-good">Bose does good.</h5>

<p>Just got these today to complete the whole system. Crisp clean sound for background noise. Wish they came with brackets to mount out the box.</p>
