<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The keyboard is very nice. I love it. No issues at all with it. It is very handy on the go! And I like how my tablet let&rsquo;s me know when it connects and disconnects when I turn it on and off</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="mother-loves-it">Mother loves it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this case for my mother and she absolutely loves it! It protects the tablet and keyboard and keeps them both secure. The keyboard has excellent battery life as well. This case works well and isn&rsquo;t as bulky and cumbersome as it may appear. Definitely recommend this case for anyone who wants a keyboard with their tablet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-get-what-you-pay-for">You get what you pay for.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case is amazing and solid. I bought a case at Bestbuy for the same price and i like the case Tsmine sells better. So why two stars? I purchased this one off Amazon because it also included the keyboard. 2 days after my original keyboard showed up the metal piece for charging pulled out with the cord. They were very quick to respond sent me a second keyboard that took some time to get to me because it came from China. I immediately put the new keyboard on a charger and came back to it several hours later to connect it to my tablet. The keyboard would power on for a few seconds and then go off. I couldn&rsquo;t even get it to stay powered with the cord in it. You would think you would test it if you were going to have to resend the second keyboard. Maybe they did test it and something happened on the way here. So if you&rsquo;re buying this for the keyboard you might want to just spend a little extra money and get a nice keyboard separately. I did try to recontact them about this so that I didn&rsquo;t have to leave bad feedback but nobody got back to me and I gave them a few weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-value-and-works">Great value and works</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>For my ellipsis7 tablet, which is a nice, basic tab, this is perfect! Charged right up, tablet had no problem interfacing with it, the case fits great, the keyboard makes many tasks easier! For the same price as the basic case at the store, a great bluetooth keyboard!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-with-a-lg-g-pad-x-10-1-v930-at-t-phone">Works great with a LG G Pad X 10.1 V930 AT&amp;T phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered the case for a friend. It fits the AT&amp;T ( LG G Pad X 10.1 V930 ) phone just fine. He wanted a keyboard and this one works great.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="thanks-for-making-my-nokia-into-a-business-tool">Thanks for making my Nokia into a business tool.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love you. My vastly expensive Nokia 2520 was purchased with a plug-in keyboard the never worked correctly, from the day I unboxed it. Without a keyboard, the Nokia is useless, unless you&rsquo;re a gamer or a texter. My uses are a little more meaningful. This keyboard brought may 2520 out of closet, I dusted it off, and with minimal trouble, had it paired to the machine. As a writer, I&rsquo;m quite persnickety about the feel of a keyboard, and this one gets an A. Bravo, and thank you helping to turn one of my most regretted purchases into a valuable business tool. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=len+mcdougall">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=len+mcdougall</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-table-case">Nice Table Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case offers great protection for my Tablet. The keyboard pairs easily to the tablet and can be used easily either one handed or two handed. The added feature of being able to remove the keyboard is nice. The keyboard attaches to the case via magnets, so this is nice and makes it feel higher quality than Velcro strips. The clips that attach the tablet to the case are adjustable, so this case could be used to fit just about any Tablet up to 8&rdquo; (ish) in size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-for-the-price">Decent for the Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love the Bluetooth keyboard and the fact it&rsquo;s pink. I&rsquo;ve seen compatible items in stores for double the money but the colors are limited. Don&rsquo;t like how my tablet isn&rsquo;t fully secure inside. It needs for corner supports, not two.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It ok. Clips to hold it in are plastic broke in a month</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>No problems.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great Product. Great Price. Timely shipping.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality. Thank you</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-use-the-case-alot-the-edges-get">if you use the case alot, the edges get &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>if you use the case alot, the edges get frayed and worn. I have had this for two months, and it is falling apart. Do not buy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="product-arrived-quickly-and-worked-great-but-stopped-working-3-days-after-warranty-period">Product arrived quickly and worked great but stopped working 3 days after warranty period</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product arrived quickly and worked great but stopped working 3 days after warranty period. It was a Christmas present. Disappointed!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="case-isnt-sturdy">Case isnt sturdy.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very disappointed in the case. It&rsquo;s already fallen apart and we&rsquo;ve only had it since december. The tablet has fell and broke because the clasps have broke that holds it in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-this">Love this</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this!!!! Connect with Bluetooth and it works perfectly</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worth more than I paid for it!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-worth-even-half-the-purchase-price">Not worth even half the purchase price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely a waste of money. Plastic clips that hold tablet in place are cheaply made and don&rsquo;t work well. Keyboard doesn&rsquo;t work well without almost pounding on the keys.</p>
