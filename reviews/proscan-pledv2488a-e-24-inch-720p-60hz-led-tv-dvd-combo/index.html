<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="a-whole-lot-to-like-few-quirks-otherwise-it-would-have-been-5">A whole lot to like, few quirks, otherwise it would have been 5*</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The picture quality is spectacular and the sound is adequate. I really enjoyed this television, but here are some quirks, have to change the TV to DVD to even have the disk inserted, meaning, it is more complicated than it needs to be. I would rather, if I insert a DVD, that it switches automatically, as that is the reason, after all, I am inserting a DVD. I love &ldquo;mute&rdquo;, as I do not tolerate commercials well, mute is a very small button on the remote. The remote is very responsive, but is laid out strangely, in comparison to others. Mine was listed as 1080i and it looked it, Mine has 3 HDMI and a &ldquo;-C&rdquo; at the end of the model number. Really quite impressed with the resolution and not disappointed with the sound either. All in all, great television and the DVD player is a nice bonus to have it in the package, despite being more manual than it needs to be. I would give the picture quality a solid 5<em>, sound 4</em>, remote, 3<em>= 4</em> total. Price and overall satisfaction 5*.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-s-a-great-tv-for-the-rv">It&rsquo;s a great TV for the RV</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great TV for the RV. The sound is just OK, but what can you expect from a small package? It is what it is. If I want better sound I will attach an external speaker unit. The picture is excellent, the DVD player works perfectly. I&rsquo;m happy!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="save-your-money">Save your money!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this last July and already the DVD does not work, moderate use and originally worked fine (because it was new), but very disappointed it did not last&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-and-simple">good and simple</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a great TV, super graphic ability, but the audio is horrendous. Yes, you can make it loud and hear it across the room, but audio is often distorted. The audio is so bad, I&rsquo;m not even sure a sound bar would help. But if you want simple, plug it into the wall for power and antenna (I use sat DISH TV via their pod thing that I have on a card table outside), it&rsquo;s great. I am out in the middle of the woods in a RV so the fact I get any TV is impressive. The fact my image is better (ie. crisper) that what we get at our house speaks well for the TV itself. My only gripe is the audio quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tv-and-dvd-work-great-the-directions-leave-a-lot-to-be-desired">TV and DVD work great! The directions leave a lot to be desired &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TV and DVD work great! The directions leave a lot to be desired and understanding the use of the remote buttons is difficult, but careful study of the fine print (I actually needed a magnifying glass) on page 8 of the manual will clarify everything. Also, nothing in the instructions tells you which way to insert the DVD into the unit. I actually thought it was defective because I kept inserting the disc in the same way that my last couple of players accepted the discs and it would not function. Then I finally noticed that it shows the correct way right beside the slot where the disc goes in.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-received-the-led-tv-on-time-and-nicely-packed-up">I have received the LED TV on time and nicely packed up</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have received the LED TV on time and nicely packed up. When I used it the first time at home the DVD jumpes or stuck and you have to take it out and back in again to watch a movie. I contacted the company and expressed my experience that there seems to be an error with the DVD player and that I cant watch a single movie without going for an back in scenes or pull the DVD back in and out again. I asked for advise and f they had other complains and what we can do about it. They never got back to me&hellip;Very disappointed I do not appreciate the bad service. Things can go wrong or do not work properly but to ignore costumers is bad. Can recommend this TV.Disappointed !</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-little-set-good-price-sound-will-need-boosting">Nice little set - good price. Sound will need boosting.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this little guy to replace a 30+ year old kitchen set. Read through most all reviews on this model as well as a few others and decided to go with this one. Picture is excellent, size is perfect and shipping-wise it came way ahead of schedule per Amazon. All seems to work fine&hellip;.don&rsquo;t get thrown off by some of the reviews about the remote - hey, looks like a remote to me and is easy to use and the set is responsive. No cable or sattelite here, just picking up digital signals via a huge antenna in my attic. Plugged in the antenna cable; used the on-screen setup menu; did a scan and pick up the stations I was hoping to see just fine. DVD player seems to work like it should.As most reviewers stated, and I have to agree&hellip;the sound quality is horrible. But, to be expected I hear on many of these flat screens. My solution - headed to the store and picked up a decent set of PC speakers ($19.00), plugged in to the headset jack and WOW. Now sounds like a real television and is an asset to the kitchen and a real space-saver. Overall, a good buy if you&rsquo;re in the market for a small set.I purchased also the Lumsing® Articulating Full Motion Swivel Tilt Tv Wall Mount Bracket here on Amazon. More than enough to handle this little guy and the arm extends out 17.5&rdquo; so can position it to watch in my breakfast nook as well. All in all&hellip;..easy setup on both. 4 stars given due to the set&rsquo;s poor sound quality only.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bought-two-and-dvd-player-broken-on-both">Bought two and DVD player broken on both</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for my sons room. The DVD player never worked. I exchanged it for a new one and it played two minutes of a DVD and then stopped. I&rsquo;ve tried playing new DVDs and old ones, but there seems to be no pattern. It doesn&rsquo;t recognize the DVD. I&rsquo;ve unplugged it and tried different combinations, but at this point There is too much doubt in my mind.The instructions for the DVD player are not useful. This is a lemon all around. Don&rsquo;t waste your money!</p>

<h5 id="tv-dvd">TV/DVD</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>TV &amp; DVD work well. Viewing needs to be pretty direct. Viewing from the side is distorted. Ok for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="boo">Boo!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for my husbands Peterbuilt big Rig he says it worked well at first now the dvd movies stop mid movie.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="really-great-except-for-audio">Really Great&hellip; Except for Audio</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received this today. Beautiful picture, lightweight, easy setup, nice DVD player, hookup with Chromecast on HDMI port was simple.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-12-volt-operation">Not 12 volt operation</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is listed as being 12 volt dc and 110 volt ac but it is not,110 ac only!I purchased it based on that feature&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="please-with-this-purchase">Please with this purchase</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The television arrived on time and it works beautifully. I have had it set up for several weeks now. The size is ideal for my living space, and the picture is clear.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dvd-direction-incorrect">DVD Direction Incorrect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well but the DVD player says to face the label toward the screen both on the tv and in the manual. This is incorrect. It will kick it put.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="picture-quality-is-good-excellent-for-the-price">picture quality is good. excellent for the price</h5>
