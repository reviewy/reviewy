<h5 id="a-great-projector-for-home-use">A great projector for home use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I decided to buy the projector because my TV was damaged. The disadvantage of TV is too big and too heavy, also occupies a large part of the living room,so that children play less space. The projector I choose supports wireless connection,which means it has no additional wiring except the power cord. It is suitable for use in the living room,so that people don&rsquo;t have to worry about walking next to it will stumble on its cable. It has the wifi module,which reduces the complexity of wiring work. So it can be hung on the ceiling or placed on top of a closet,which is the most suitable place for projector. Neither occupy room space nor make the children bump into it when they play. The projector display is very good. It can support the playback of 1080p resolution video. And it has a brightness of up to 3000 lumens ,so in the evening the playback is very clear and during the daytime only needs to close the curtains,you can get a satisfactory projection effect. Meanwhile it supports AirPlay, so I can stream the video from iPhone or iPad to the projector,do not need complex settings, and even my grandfather can use it without helping(Thank Steve Jobs). Finally,the projector doesn&rsquo;t even need to add projector screen. I directly projected the video on the wall and also got a satisfactory effect. Very recommended to buy.</p>

<h5 id="fabulous-projector">Fabulous projector!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector is very easy to set up and use. It has it&rsquo;s own operating system so you can download items directly to it. We hooked it up to our Tap and it was awesome! We aslo plugged the Firestick directly into it and controlled it just as we would have on the TV. The picture quality is great as well. It&rsquo;s great for family night when everyone is watching a movie.It does not come with a stand which makes projecting it a little challenging when small children or dogs are around. I am an educator and was concerned that the light bulb would be delicate and extremely expensive like the ones used at our school - this is not the case. Although we probably should wait until the unit cools down before moving, moving it as soon as we are done has not caused any problems. My husband has looked at the bulb and has assured me that it is not the delicate one that I was worried about either.Since it is an expensive product, I asked about being able to purchase insurance on it but it is not offered. The company assured me that if I had any concerns with the product, I could contact them directly.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-product">Awesome product!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> My two kids like to watch TV at close range and I&rsquo;m worried about their vision loss. my friend introduced this projector helping to solove my worries. Now I have been using this unit for a couple days , I playing with all the features.all I can say is :wow looks really.the picture is clearer than I thought and the sound quality is better than I expected.kids was stunned by the big screen at first,they excited touch the screen (actually it&rsquo;s touch the wall ,haha).the build in wifi was easy to set up add to my wireless network. It&rsquo;s ok during the day,but it works better at night. There&rsquo;s a little theater in the house ,my family are very happy!</p>

<h5 id="my-friend-bought-this-nice-projector-couple-months-ago-and-introduce-me-to-this">My friend bought this nice projector couple months ago and introduce me to this &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My friend bought this nice projector couple months ago and introduce me to this product. This projector have 3000 lumens for the brightness, built-in Android system can download various apps. Some of the projector claim have WiFi connection, but only for screen mirroring not truly WiFi. This projector is the most powerful device I have ever see. I use my wireless mouse and keyboard instead of remote controler to control it. I usually use my projector at night time so I can not connected my speakers so I use my Bluetooth headphones. This projector have 2 HDMI ports and 2 USB ports to use also built-in Bluetooth. I highly recommend to buy this projector instead of any other portable ones because is wasting money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have looked and looked for a projector, I didn&rsquo;t know much about them so I was unsure what to buy but this one was amazing! Amazing technology applied in this projector, I was able to do in my ways using this projector. I can watch a movie, play games, connect with suitable media gadgets and even using it with my presentations. The projector lets you select the color of the wall you&rsquo;re projecting onto, and I have to say the picture was amazing. The image is stunning even I adjust it to the maximum screen display. SO I think I did a great smart shopping.</p>
