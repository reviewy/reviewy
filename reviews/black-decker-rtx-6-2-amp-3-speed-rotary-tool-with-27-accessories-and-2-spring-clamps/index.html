<h5 id="solid-rotary-tool-performance-beware-of-the-gradually-decreasing-warranty-period">Solid Rotary Tool Performance (Beware Of The Gradually Decreasing Warranty Period)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using this Black &amp; Decker rotary tool - which is the equivalent of the more familiar Dremel tool, for more than ten years now. The three speeds and ergonomics of this tool have always been wonderful, and fine home/residential use. I&rsquo;ll concede that I have had three of these rotary tools fail, over the last ten years - most of those failures associated with the induction motor. Luckily, on each occasion Black &amp; Decker was true to its warranty, and after determining that a repair was not possible - they quickly forwarded a replacement tool.You should be aware that my rotary tool was originally covered by a five year warranty. I noted on my last replacement tool, that warranty has subsequently been &ldquo;narrowed&rdquo; down to two years. Fortunately, I kept my original documentation, and Black &amp; Decker has been willing to honor the warranty associated with the original tool purchase date (5-year). This tool works well, but has product durability limitations, and should work well enough for non-commercial use, but be aware of the now 2-year warranty (which will almost certainly slip to a 1-year warranty at some point in the future).</p>

<h5 id="black-decker-rtx-6-2-amp-3-speed-rotary-tool">Black &amp; Decker RTX-6 2-Amp 3-Speed Rotary Tool</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having had a Dremel rotary tool I was not too keen on buying another one, but thought there has to be something better out there than my under-powered Dremel. I can now tell you that the B&amp;D RTX-6 beats that Dremel in every way possible. First of all, it has more than twice the power.Tool changes are much easier. Having an on and off switch rather than a rotary switch is far better. And, the three speed selection is all I ever need.Not only is this a better tool tool, but far less in price. When do you ever see a combination like that?I can recommend this tool without reservation.</p>

<h5 id="solid-tool-but-some-quality-control-issues-which-customer-service-remedied">Solid tool but some quality control issues (which customer service remedied).</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well but there were some quality control issues. The collet included with the &ldquo;kit&rdquo; was too small for the included attachments and was also jammed inside the collet nut. I emailed customer service and they immediately sent me two new collets just to be sure I had the right one. I was able to pop the jammed collet out of the nut by inserting the screw end of the mandrel attachment into the top of the collet and nut then resting the other end of the mandrel on my counter and VERY gently tapping the nut with a hammer. I also learned that the dremel brand &ldquo;Quick Change Collet Nut Kit&rdquo; fits just fine as well so now I have multiple back ups should anything get stuck again but so far that hasn&rsquo;t been and issue. Dremel 4485 Quick Change Collet Nut Kit Otherwise, the rotary tool itself seems plenty powerful and versatile. This is my first time using this type of tool so I have nothing to compare it too and my needs are basic &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; type needs.</p>

<h5 id="good-product-bad-ad">Good Product, Bad Ad</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Two clicks past lowest setting it gets very very loud, just something to note but not an issue. They hover in the shades of grey in how they describe what you are going to get with this product. Not really 3 speed. It&rsquo;s a variable speed dial with little white H, M, L letters painted on as their respective points. Which really is better, but I&rsquo;m very curious as to why they advertize 3 speed. Also about this 30 accessory deal&hellip; Don&rsquo;t think they have a right to call it 30 accessories. More like 4 accessories with 20 extra saw disks and 6 extra sandpaper rings. The two clamps are good though.My first use was to deal with my dog&rsquo;s nails. She has never had them trimmed in her life and she weighs over 100 pounds so you can imagine. Anyways I sawed off the nail a couple cm in front of the quick with a disk cutting attachment and then ground it smooth with the grindstone attachment. For the purpose of cutting a dogs nails this would be difficult to use on dogs scared of noise. On it&rsquo;s lowest setting it is very very quiet but its hardly enough umph to grind the nail down at least on a dog as large as mine. As I said before, after about two clicks of the variable speed dial up in speed, it gets very loud.For any other use this is a great dremel especially for the price. Plenty of power and in my opinion more reliable because of the coord. I only knock one star because I was majorly let down by the &ldquo;30 accessories&rdquo; though the value of the clamps plus the 4 accessories is more than the difference between this product and the one that is the dremel only so still a good deal.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="accessories-are-unusable-if-you-buy-this-tool-buy-it-alone-and-purchase-quality-accessories">Accessories are unusable. If you buy this tool, buy it alone and purchase quality accessories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Right out of the box the accessories are unusable. I am working with bone, cutting it and shaping it. I managed to cut the bone with a cutting disk although one disk broke in the process. I then prepared to sand the bone but the drum discs are too loose and fly off the drum mandrel. Either the discs are too wide or the mandrel is too narrow. The drum comes apart with just one screw so I took it apart to see if there was some way to adjust it (there is not) but now the screw will not go back in so I&rsquo;ll be purchasing a new Dremel brand drum mandrel. Plus, the shafts of the accessories get stuck in the chuck every time and I need two pliers to get them out so I&rsquo;ll need to buy a Dremel Chuck. I&rsquo;ll keep using the cutting discs until they all break. Good thing I&rsquo;m not on a deadline.Based only on the very few minutes I was able to use this tool, the tool itself seems to be okay but the accessories are very low quality. Buy the tool alone without the accessories and invest the $10 saved in purchasing quality accessories. I just checked here on Amazon and the Dremel brand accessories are each under $10 anyway.Update: at my local big box store I found a generic 200-piece accessory kit for $10. The quality seems good enough. That accessory kit is similar to this Hitachi 115005 Rotary Tool Accessory Kit, 200-Piece found here on Amazon (same case, too.)</p>

<h5 id="great-value-seems-fine">Great value, seems fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great value, seems fine, good torque for how I use it light grinding etc. Definitely need to purchase the Dremel 4486 multipro keyless chuck. The chuck provided fits nothing</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>cannot use for long time</p>

<p>Not as advertised. I had under 10 pieces total. Way less than advertised.</p>

<p>Its a nice tool. But it doesn&rsquo;t come with all the pieces. I guess you have too buy them separately.</p>
