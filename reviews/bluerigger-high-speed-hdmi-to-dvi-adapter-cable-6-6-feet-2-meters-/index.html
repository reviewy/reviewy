<h5 id="true-dvi-i-d-to-hdmi-connector-works-connecting-a-2007-mac-mini-dvi-to-hdmi-perfectly">True DVI-I/D to HDMI connector, works connecting a 2007 Mac-Mini DVI to HDMI perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a mid 2007 Apple mac-mini Core2 Duo with a DVI video output connector. I have used the DVI to VGA adapter for years thinking it was a DVI-A and did not have DVI-D signals.. its also a Single Speed so missing 6 pins in the center.. I was wrong. This cable Beautifully connected the DVI-I (for Integrated, &lsquo;both&rsquo; DVI-A and DVI-D signal pins) connector on the mac-mini so that the DVI-D signals would connect to my HDMI input on my monitor (all passive/native no active signal processing in the cable.. the results were absolutely &ldquo;stunning&rdquo;. It came in a sealed bag with a warranty card and the pictures don&rsquo;t do it justice.. its a big rubber corded DVI-D to HDMI connector cable. Heavy Duty feeling but very flexible. Has a rubber gasket around the mating connector parts so when they are pushed into their sockets they &ldquo;seal&rdquo; and stop you from pushing too far. Apples hardware costs a lot above normal, but they usually default to very flexible.. I assumed they only included DVD-A because of the VGA passive dongle they threw in the box for free.. not even thinking they could be that forward thinking to make sure the connection was DVI-I (for both) saves me time way down the line these many years later and gives new life to an old tiny machine. Happy Ending.</p>

<h5 id="quality-cable-at-a-great-price">Quality cable at a great price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I upgraded my system and decided that I should upgrade my cables in the process. Besides, I also wanted to use the HDMI connector and avoid a possible signal degradation issue when using an adapter.This cable has a very well-built feel to it, nice feeling materials. It connects well with the extended screw grips in the DVI side, and the HDMI side plugs in firmly and stays where it&rsquo;s put. I like the matching blue ends to help identify these connectors among the dozens I have due to the several systems behind my desk.I use this cable to switch between multiple connections on my monitor and it&rsquo;s working great for that purpuse. I can switch to the VGA port to use my KVM and support several systems there, or back to my DVI port and this system. It allows me great flexibility in chosing which device uses the monitor at the time. The length is about right for placing a system on the floor behind a desk and them reaching up to a monitor that&rsquo;s mounted on a arm system like I have. It&rsquo;s long enough that I can swing the arms around and nothing binds. See my other reviews if you are considering a monitor mount as there&rsquo;s a nice one for a good price on Amazon too.</p>

<h5 id="blue-rigger-is-the-way-to-go">Blue Rigger is the WAY TO GO!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Media cables are so overpriced nowadays, that the glowing reviews and low prices of the BlueRigger cables caught my attention. Keep in mind this cable is NOT MEANT to transfer audio, only video to a monitor or similar device. However, this cable worked so well I bought a second one! These cables work both ways, with a laptop connected to the DVI end and HDMI going to our 55&rdquo; TV and then in the office we have a mac mini (HDMI) connected to a LED monitor (DVI). I&rsquo;m very pleased with the purchase, and given my history with Blue Rigger cables (we have multiple types in the house) I will continue to buy them.</p>

<h5 id="great-cables">GREAT cables!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these cables because I have Lenovo Mini Dock docking stations for both my W520 and W530 laptops. I originally chose these and DisplayPort capable monitors because DP is an open standard and everyone in the tech world had high hopes for it when it was first released, offering higher quality, more features, etc. The truth is, at least for me, there is no advantage to DP over HDMI or DVI and there is one huge disadvantage&hellip;the gigantic DP plugs. I purchased high quality DP cables to go with the displayports on the docks. I immediately noticed that any bump of the laptop or the dock caused the image to lose sync for a moment. This, I discovered, is due to the strain that is put on the DP cables due to the size and weight of both the cable and connector. I decided to give the DVI ports a try. Since one of my two monitors doesn&rsquo;t have a DVI in, i figured I&rsquo;d just go all in and get 4 of these cables and do everything from DVI to HDMI. I couldn&rsquo;t be happier! These cables are obviously well made. They seated firmly in both the HDMI and DVI ports. The screws hold them in the dock so no more losing display when something gets bumped around. The blue color is also a nice touch and gives them a hint of class. I&rsquo;d love to see bluerigger take this design&hellip;good quality cabling, blue metal connectors and extend it to other types of cables. I&rsquo;d buy in a heartbeat! I&rsquo;ve already suggested these to coworkers since we all use Thinkpads with the minidocks.</p>

<h5 id="good-quality-cable-at-an-affordable-price-works-perfectly-to-hook-xbox-one-up-to-a-dvi-monitor-won-t-carry-audio-signal">Good quality cable at an affordable price. Works perfectly to hook Xbox One up to a DVI Monitor. Won&rsquo;t carry Audio signal.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are good quality cables at a great price. I&rsquo;ve been using this for a month now with no issues.I bought two of these cables (different lengths). This One is used to hook up an Xbox One HDMI output to the DVI Input on a PC monitor. Works great for that. I was previously using an HDMI to VGA adapter that went bad. I prefer this solution since the video quality is a bit better.It is important to note DVI doesn&rsquo;t carry the audio signal of course. You&rsquo;ll need to have something else in place to carry the audio signal. For my Xbox One I have an optical audio to 3.5 mm stereo converter that works well.I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to recommend these to anyone needing a way to hook up an HDMI output to a DVI monitor etc. They&rsquo;re affordable and seem to be great quality.</p>

<h5 id="great-cable">Great Cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had it for a few days now and it is very well constructed and works great. I am using it to go from a Plugable Pro8 tablet docking station to a 32&rdquo; Philips TV so, I can have a larger screen for my HP Stream 7. The cable is black flexible rubber like material and is a little under a <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; thick. The cable is labeled &ldquo;AWM Style 20276 80 degrees C 30V VW-1&rdquo; and &ldquo;High Speed HDMI TM Cable with Enternet&rdquo; E252840&rdquo;. The ends are black molded rubber like material with a blue metal wrapped around it. The connectors are gold plated and fit tight. Nice cable would get more of BlueRigger cables.</p>
