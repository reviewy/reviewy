<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="beware-9-99-is-not-for-kindle-fire-7-kids-edition">Beware!!!! $9.99 is not for kindle Fire 7&rsquo; kids edition!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The 7-8 inch sleeve does not fit kindle Fire 7&rsquo; with case. It does not zipper up. I suggest getting a bigger size.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-so-good">So far so good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good! Its stretchy, durable, and cute. My daughter likes it.I will update if there are any issues, but it seems to be manufactured well. It even fita the tablet with the kid friendly case on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="personally-i-would-like-a-little-more-protection-on-it-but-it-is-a-great-little-case-for-the-price">Personally I would like a little more protection on it, but it is a great little case for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little case. It holds the Kids Fire edition with the bulky case perfectly. I always have to make sure I put the tablet in with the back facing the front pocket making sure that the charger won&rsquo;t get knocked into the screen&hellip; I always worry about it getting cracked. Because of my paranoia I am only giving 4 stars. I think the back should have a firm piece across it to protect the screen from jutting edges or accidentally dropping it on a surface that is not perfectly flat. I mean it is built for the kids edition and that means it has to be ruff and tumble.Other than that I do really like this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="durable-a-little-small-for-accessories">Durable! A little small for accessories</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Durable, and cute! I love the case and so does my son. However, the zipper portion is smaller than I anticipated and not much room for the charging cord and wall plug. I wish I would have ordered the case the is bigger to accommodate the cord and bumper. We use a mounting bracket in the car which will fit in the case with the tablet when they&rsquo;re attached. I love that it has two zippers on the big pocket. We are using it for the sprout channel cubby tablet. This tablet comes with a green bumper to put on the tablet to protect from dropping. So I can store the tablet with either the bumper atttached or the mounting bracket but not both. I would absolutely but this same case in a bigger version, if you&rsquo;re looking for storage for other items. Great product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-and-neat">Nice and neat</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great case. It&rsquo;s very slim but the material seems to be sufficient for padding and protection. I did purchase this for my daughter&rsquo;s Leapfrog Epic and it is too small. I still manage to squeeze it onto the tablet with the silicon casing on but had I known that this was so snug I probably would not have purchased it. It fits great with the casing off but a 4-yr-old kind of needs that casing. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s nice. It has a nice little pocket on the front that we keep the charger stowed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="almost-a-5">Almost a 5 🌟</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Would have been 5 Stars&hellip;Love everything! Very cute, is durable, has 2 zippers so can close or leave a tiny gap open anywhere to accommodate position of charging port if want to charge tab while keeping protected. It has a decent size 2nd pocket on side that zips closed too. It is big enough to hold the charger and ear buds.The seller shipped asap and arrived earlier than expected. It came in a padded packing envelope so I was able to get delivered in my mailbox VS going to the post office (our carrier is on foot so we can&rsquo;t receive any box deliveries) THE ONLY REASON NOT GIVING 5 STARS, is that the case is obviously made as inexpensively as possible &amp; cut corners on craftsmanship. The zipper got caught on all the excess thread that was not trimmed or tied off and the case was almost ruined. After carefully gently tugging and coaxing (15 minutes) I was able to open and sewed up the loose threads and cut excess that were hanging. We purchased 2 of these cases and the 2nd on was fine, but as a precaution I cut all the long loose threads that were mainly a problem on the side pouch for holding accessories. Over all a great product and great price, would definitely buy again. Just to be careful I would trim extra loose threads so they don&rsquo;t get caught in zipper like ours did.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-that-there-is-a-small-zipper-area-on-the">I love that there is a small zipper area on the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this for my Seven year old daughter to go along with the Amazon fire tablet (for kids) . The color is just as it is shown very vibrant! This case is very well made. My daughters tablet also has the foam type case on it and it fits into this case perfectly without having to remove the protective case. I love that there is a small zipper area on the front for my daughter to store her charger ! Love this very convenient!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="adorable-case-ibought-it-for-my-son-s-leappad-explorer">Adorable case! Ibought it for my son&rsquo;s Leappad Explorer &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Adorable case! Ibought it for my son&rsquo;s Leappad Explorer 2 and it fits well. There is a zipper pocket on the outside where I was able to put in a few cartridges. It only unzips about halfway..so the tablet has to be removed in order to play. I&rsquo;d love it if he were able to fully unzip the case and have the tablet be held in with elastic or something so he didn&rsquo;t have to take it out all the way. But it&rsquo;s a great travel case. Love the pattern and soft material. He likes how it looks like a briefcase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great grandson loves it. Having the place for charger is easy to find when you need it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-case">Nice Case</h5>
