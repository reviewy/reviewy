<h5 id="this-mount-easily-holds-my-galaxy-s5-with-a-case-and-even">This mount easily holds my Galaxy S5 with a case and even &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This mount scared me at first but after having it mounted to my motorcycle for the whole season, it has far surpassed my expectations! This mount easily holds my Galaxy S5 with a case and even my Garmin GPS that is even bigger than my phone. It has held my devices on mountain runs and straight stretch &ldquo;closed road&rdquo; pulls with not a single issue. I have paired this mount with the following links and recommend everyone to buy this mount for a phone or GPS.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KWPJ04/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055PH0XA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005KWPJ04/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0055PH0XA/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2</a></p>

<h5 id="i-don-t-have-enough-praise">I don&rsquo;t have enough praise.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have 3 of these. Yes, I could easily have only one, and move that one when I need it, but. I love the x-grip so much I decided to permanently mount one in my truck. That allows me to move the other two from motorcycle 1 to car 2 to mountain bike to motorcycle 2 to scooter to 4 Wheeler 1 or 2, etc. Once you get used to having one in your life, you will never go back. I&rsquo;ve exposed them to motorcycle rides well over the 100mph mark; in driving rain; snow; mud; shaking and vibration on motorcycle handlebars; jumps with hard landings on 4 wheelers etc. I&rsquo;ve never ever had my phone come out. Ever. This is the most reliable phone holster you can get. I buy them as gifts and would recommend one to anyone as my confidence in them is sky high. I can also confirm that the RAM aqua box does fit, albeit snug in the Mount. Simply awesome.</p>

<h5 id="works-great-exactly-what-i-needed-yamaha-r3">Works great, exactly what i needed. Yamaha R3</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly what i needed, works great.I just don&rsquo;t trust tank bags with 800 dollar phones so wanted something easier to use, read, and was secured to the bike.iPhone 6 no problems with fit, do have to adjust the placement of the phone due to the volume buttons on the side. With the tether that was included I do not have a concern with the phone coming out, but i def would never use it without the rubber tether.My placement pretty much stays out of the wind behind the windshield so haven&rsquo;t had any issues with movement etc.Don&rsquo;t forget to super glue the rubber tips. Also **saw people asking the question about tether, mine came with it.Works great on Yamaha R3 with the:Ram Mount Motorcycle Handlebar Clamp BaseRam Mount ShortM6x50mm 12.9 Alloy Steel Screw Cap Point Hex Socket Screws</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-my-semi-truck">Perfect for my Semi Truck.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a mount that was universal for all of today&rsquo;s cell phones with or without thick protected cases and that it wouldn&rsquo;t budge or slip out or that the mount would break, when I found this mount I thought It looks perfect, so I ordered the cradle for examination, I placed my galaxy SIII in it, held it from the ball and swung it around in all directions and it was just as I wanted it, I ordered the other 2 pieces and it was easy just drill 2 holes on a smooth surface and used <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; wood screws. I highly recommend this mount be it to truck drivers or anyone else.Combined with the Diamond base ball and the short double socket (links below).<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002KO5XVU/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?qid=1423367409&amp;sr=8-5&amp;pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&amp;keywords=ram+mount&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=31bLdbUXGtL&amp;ref=plSrchhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B005KWPJ04/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?qid=1423367409&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ram+mountUpdate:">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B002KO5XVU/ref=mp_s_a_1_5?qid=1423367409&amp;sr=8-5&amp;pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&amp;keywords=ram+mount&amp;dpPl=1&amp;dpID=31bLdbUXGtL&amp;ref=plSrchhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B005KWPJ04/ref=mp_s_a_1_2?qid=1423367409&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=ram+mountUpdate:</a> upgraded to LG G4 which is 5.5 inch phone still fits even with an otterbox Defender case</p>

<h5 id="wonderful">Wonderful!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had this for two months, but my experiences with it have been nothing but positive. I&rsquo;ve haven&rsquo;t used it every day, since I certainly don&rsquo;t need a GPS for my daily travel from and to my workplace, but still, I&rsquo;ve used it numerous times with zero issues.I&rsquo;ve driven my motorcycle at a maximum speed of 90 km/h (55 mph) over roads so bumpy you&rsquo;d swear you&rsquo;re in an earthquake, and I&rsquo;ve never had any displacement issues. Some people complain about the phone flying off the grip, or the grip uncontrollably rotating the phone, and I have suffered neither. The phone hasn&rsquo;t even moved enough to touch a button, even though due to the size and design of my phone one of the holder&rsquo;s arms sits right between the &ldquo;On&rdquo; and &ldquo;Volume Up&rdquo; buttons, milimeters from each.My phone is a Motorola Moto G 2nd Gen with a Fosmon STURDY case. Granted, there&rsquo;s a chance the case&rsquo;s material is better at holding its grip against the rubber arms of the holder than the phone&rsquo;s material, but I doubt they&rsquo;re much different. My opinion? Those negative reviews stem from either older versions for the holder which have then been improved or, most likely, from user error, either by using the holder improperly or not using the correct model for their phone size.So far so great. Some negative reviews gave me reservations at first, but these have been completely dissipated.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-pretty-much-anything">Great For Pretty Much Anything !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I personally use it on my Yamaha R1. The product is solid..doesn&rsquo;t feel cheap whatsoever. Only down side it came with some paint missing from the center of the ball joint.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fit perfect on my Ram Mount, i love it how it works</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buttons-on-iphone-can-be-an-issue">Buttons on iPhone can be an issue.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great potential but issues occur with using with an iPhone. The problem is that the feet end up adjusting the volume down as the buttons on the side are close to the rubber feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ram-mounts-are-the-best">RAM-Mounts Are The Best</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This large fits my Samsung S6 Edge just fine. It actually comes with glue if you wish (and you don&rsquo;t have to) pop off the rubber ends and glue them back on.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>works well, good investment</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="rocl-solid-mount">Rocl solid mount</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Went down doing about 45-50 mph and my phone was still locked securely in the mount on my bike. Can&rsquo;t ask for anything better than that</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="far-superior-than-anything-else">far superior than anything else</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing rock, far superior than anything else, especially the older design I had with the clumsy adjustable arms. LOVE IT!!! (Samsung Galaxy S5)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-as-advertised-has-held-my-phone-securely-on">Works as advertised, has held my phone securely on &hellip;</h5>

<p>Works as advertised, has held my phone securely on the motorcycle, so 4 stars since the phone is still with me.</p>
