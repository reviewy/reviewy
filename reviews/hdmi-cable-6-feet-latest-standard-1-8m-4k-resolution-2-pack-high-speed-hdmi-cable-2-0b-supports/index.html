<h5 id="important-cable-clarity-for-the-win">IMPORTANT - CABLE CLARITY FOR THE WIN!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>IMPORTANT:I went to Best Buy looking for a 4k cable to connect my 4k TV to my computer to playback 4k video files. At best buy, a 12 foot cable was ~$60&hellip; I foolishly bought it and a second one because I needed to connect a couple of devices.Then I decided to check online to see if there were any other cables for cheaper. I stumbled onto Ultra Clarity and WOW they are amazing. The image quality is top notch. I returned the Best Buy cables and told them off for selling me cables for such rip off prices.DO NOT purchase HDMI cables from name-brands or retail stores&hellip; they are rip offs. They prey on the masses who do not realize that the cost of a cable is less than a dollar and they can fool us with marketing ploys.CABLE CLARITY FOR THE WIN!</p>

<h5 id="hdmi-cable-2-0-1-5-feet-4k-ultra-speed">HDMI Cable 2.0 1.5 feet 4K Ultra-Speed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When we bought out Smart TV, I thought wow, 4 HDMI ports, how will I ever use those? Now, I am wondering why there are not more!!! LOL :-) So, that brought me to the point of adding on a HDMI switch and the need for short HDMI cables and thus this product. Here is what I found when I received these cables:1. These are some of the thickest cables I have ever used! Guess to meet the new standards there are thicker wires or more of them to give you all of the bandwidth and features. In spite of that, these are some of the easiest cables to work with. They easily made the short loops from devices to HDMI switch without complaint or being so stiff as to not bend.2. My ROKU supports 4K streaming and it worked flawlessly over these cables!! GREAT PICTURE!!! Too bad there is not more 4K content out there!!3. Having this particular color in the cable makes them quick to identify when you are looking into the dark space behind all of the equipment.4. Construction of the cables appears to be very well done! Cables are NOT stiff, connectors feel solid and work exactly as they should with a good fit.I am very pleased with these cables and would highly recommend them if you need short HDMI cables!!</p>

<h5 id="great-value-for-hdmi-2-0-cables">Great Value for HDMI 2.0 Cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Though the standards for HDMI 2.0 appear to be changing, these cables are a terrific value. They are version 2.0 and support data speeds up to 18 Gbps. The 3 foot length was perfect for my application, connecting components to an AVR in a fairly confined space. The cable is also cloth-wrapped and isn&rsquo;t enormously thick. It is quite flexible and the connector heads are small enough to use in tight spaces. The HDMI connectors aren&rsquo;t 24k gold or platinum or whatever, but they are well-made and ship with dustcaps. The white and red-striped color scheme may not be to everyone&rsquo;s taste, but, for something I won&rsquo;t ever see, it doesn&rsquo;t bother me. It certainly doesn&rsquo;t affect their operation. The low price (surprisingly cheaper than Monoprice, where I usually buy all of my cables) combined with getting 2 cables, instead of 1, makes these Ultra Clarity cables a winner.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-hdmi-s">EXCELLENT HDMI&rsquo;S &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>EXCELLENT HDMI&rsquo;S &hellip; I NOW HAVE MY WHOLE SYSTEM HOOK UP WITH THESE CABLES &hellip; THE FIRST ONE I USED TO CONNECT MY LAP TOP TO MY TV TO STREAM DIRECTLY AND IT WAS FASTER,BETTER SOUND AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BETTER PICTURE&hellip; WITH THAT PROOF I HOOKED UP MY WHOLE SYSTEM WITH THESE CABLES&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="4k-all-the-way">4K all the way</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needed these after upgrading to a 4K tv. Old HDMI cables were showing up as insufficient with a roku 4. Switched to these and its 4k all the way. Great price for a 2-pack. They are braided, thick, sturdy &amp; hefty. Not super flexible, but that wasn&rsquo;t important for me.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-for-price-was-weary-but">Great for price, was weary, but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to find a 4K cable for my SLI GTX980s. I was hesitant about the price being so low for a two pack of these, but for the price they deliver. Are they grossly overpriced HDMI cables that will make a wet dream appear on your display for $500 each? No, but they display in 4K just fine at 120Hz, seriously, no issues whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-quality">Excellent quality!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent quality but&hellip; very rigid. Make sure you don&rsquo;t plan on bending this cable too much&hellip; it might fight you a little bit (especially around a tight corner). If flexibility is key to your application, try a different brand.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-looking-cables-but-quality-may-be-an-issue">Nice looking cables but quality may be an issue</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I connected one of these between an XBox One S and an LG 65&rdquo; E series OLED 4K UHD TV. I was noticing a lot of missing data on some scenes with the previous cable that this one completely remedied. So far they perform as expected.Update: I have been using these for a few months now and the one that I had originally connected between the XBox and my 4K TV has started to fail. I&rsquo;m not sure why but the signal keeps dropping between the 2 devices. The video just goes black when this happens and I would have to restart the XBox and TV. It had gotten so bad that even starting over didn&rsquo;t last very long. I swapped in the other cable in the package and the dropping stopped. For the price they seemed like a great deal but like everything else you get what you pay for.</p>

<h5 id="no-mixups-here">No mixups here</h5>

<p>The red &amp; white cable stands out like jet plane at an antique car show, and I love it.It does the job, I got it quick, and solved my problems&hellip;. What else is there</p>
