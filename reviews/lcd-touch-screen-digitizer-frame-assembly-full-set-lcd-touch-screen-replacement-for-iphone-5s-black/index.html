<h5 id="iphone-5s-has-a-new-fully-functioning-screen">iPhone 5s has a new fully functioning screen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading several reviews about replacing your own screen I was a bit worried that I would &ldquo;mess&rdquo; up my phone beyond the broken screen, I found that I could get my phone fixed for around $129 if I took it to a professional. Recovering from Christmas spending I decided to take the chance and spend the $35 for the kit, I am glad that I did, my phone looks like new again all the functions work.This was my first time replacing a screen, iPhone 5s, it took me about 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to complete the task. Make sure to allow yourself plenty of time and be very patient with each step. In addition to the tools that came with the purchase I used a micro flat head screw driver and tweezers. Also make sure to have a clean workspace and place to organize the screws and plates as you remove them.I will provided an update should I have any issues with the new screen in the months to come.Video link in shipping confirmation email provided step by step detailed instructions for installation process.</p>

<p>LCD Touch Screen Digitizer Frame Assembly Full Set LCD Touch Screen Replacement for iPhone 5S - Black, I buy this but someone send me other Lcd is diferent</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-well-but-slight-decrease-in-image-quality">Works well but slight decrease in image quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked well for me, but I took away a star because there is a slightly lower difference in image quality compared to the original iphone screen. Not a big deal though because I would gladly trade a tiny bit of image quality for a screen that isn&rsquo;t cracked. One thing to keep in mind is that replacement screens are more fragile than original screens. That&rsquo;s not the fault of this screen that&rsquo;s just how it is with all replacement screens so make sure you put a good case on it once you&rsquo;ve replaced it!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-out-fine">Worked out fine</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The screen i received worked out okay once I installed it, there were 2 caveats worth mentioning if you plan to install this screen yourself. First, I have installed a lot of iPhone screens so I have experience doing this job. The first issue I had was that the bracket that holds the ear speaker in would not clip back into place without putting a lot of fore on it so I ended up not clipping it and relying on the 2 screws that also hold the bracket in place do the job because I did not want to risk cracking the screen, second, when I went to install the screen to the back of the iPhone 5S by tucking in the top of the screen to the back housing it would not go all the way against the top of the frame until I bent the plastic tabs on the top of the screen&rsquo;s frame down slightly, after doing this I was able to get the screen to sit in place completely against the top of the housing as it should. I have never had to do this to a new screen before and it was not that big of a deal to me but it sure could be for someone who has never done this procedure before.The screen look very good and functions as intended so I would recommend this screen and seller to anyone in the market to replace their iPhone 5S screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="touchscreen-works-very-poorly">Touchscreen works very poorly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Assembly was not easy, but easy enough. I followed a youtube tutorial and it took around an hour.My complaint is with the functionality of the new screen. I can no longer use the touch screen with any consistency. Every other time that I use the phone, the screen with not recognize my touches, or it will record the touch in a different location, or it will scroll away to the top of the screen. I suspect that this is an issue with the number of pixels in the digitizer and with the sensitivity of the screen to foreign residue, such as fingerprints. When I clean the screen, most of the time it works better, at least well enough to use, but then the next time I use the phone, it is already unusable again, and I have to try to wipe it down again. It&rsquo;s extremely frustrating, and I think I&rsquo;ll have to try another replacement. This time, I&rsquo;ll try to get a higher quality product. Regarding the low pixel count, I&rsquo;m don&rsquo;t actually understand the technical design of the phone, or even if what I&rsquo;m seeing are called pixels, but when I tilt the screen across the light, I can what look like pixels, and they are in blocks with lots of empty space in between them, and I never recall having seen anything like that on my original screen.Edit: I ordered a glass screen protector to see if it would help the issue. It did help, so it must be that the glass on this product is extremely sensitive to fingerprints. Bumped the rating from one start to two. Still think it&rsquo;s not a great product if you have to order more parts to make it work properly.</p>

<h5 id="touchscreens-busted-on-all-units-i-installed">Touchscreens busted on all units I installed!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been installing phone screens for years, and usually, haven&rsquo;t had issues with Chinese screens, but this one is terrible. The screen is slightly discolored, although you wouldn&rsquo;t notice it unless you held it up to another iPhone. The touch screen the worst. If anything makes contact with the display that isn&rsquo;t your finger, it will make random taps on your screen, sending messages or swiping in and out of menus. Sometimes, the touch will refuse to work at all, and you will need to whack it hard with your thumb to make it work again. I bought two of these screens, one for me and one for a friend, and both have the same issue. I know it might seem like a good choice, but don&rsquo;t waste your time, as you will end up buying an Apple one anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-good-iphone-screen-replacement-kit">A good iPhone screen replacement kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This screen was as easy to put in as it&rsquo;s possible for an iPhone 5 screen to be. Fit is excellent and it brought new life to the phone that I replaced a broken screen in. The directions provided by the seller are clear and easy to follow.I took about an hour to replace the old screen, including the time required to move the camera, speaker, and fingerprint reader/button from the old screen to the new.The digitizer and lcd connectors fit crisply and snugly onto the connectors in the phone. A prior replacement had a digitizer connection that was just a hair loose and easy to knock out of place. This one was harder to get into place to begin with, but far easier to keep there while I finished reassembling the phone.</p>
