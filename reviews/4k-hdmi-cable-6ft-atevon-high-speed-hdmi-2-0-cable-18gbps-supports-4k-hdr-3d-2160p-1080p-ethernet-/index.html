<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="the-nicest-hdmi-cable-i-have-ever-seen">The nicest HDMI Cable I have ever seen!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>All I can say is WOW! This ATEVON HDMI Cable is prestige quality! The connectors are all metal. Very elegant heavy metal. The cable is strong and extremely sturdy. You don&rsquo;t have to worry about it getting damaged with the braided wrap around it. The picture quality is amazing and there is no lag at all. It is super fast. I am extremely happy with my purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="your-search-is-over-this-is-it">Your search is over, this is it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I was immediately impressed with this cable when I pulled it out of the package. I&rsquo;d never seen metal heads for HDMI cable with a polished chrome finish on them before, or a cable that was braided and extremely strong, yet still easily able to return to a straight line after being bent or coiled. In the words of my wife, &ldquo;A Chinchilla could probably chew on this cable and not break through it&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve tried Amazon Basic HDMI cable, Twisted Veins, and various other brands, but this is EASILY my favorite to-date.I use two high color-gamut monitors for video editing, as well as gaming, which requires a good amount of bandwidth, but no matter how much data I pour through this cable it has lived up to the listed specs. I&rsquo;ll update my review if this thing ever breaks, but I understand why it comes with a lifetime warranty, because this thing is well built.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-sturdy-cables">Great sturdy cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had an old HDMI cable for about 3 years now and decided it was time for an upgrade. Which I did a lot of research looking for the best 4K HDMI cable. My research led me to this the set of HDMI cables and all I can say &ldquo;The best cable out on the market right now.&rdquo; The cable is strong and sturdy, won&rsquo;t bend easily, I like the gold plated tips for the connector. I can tell that this cable is going to last a very long time. Plus, when I plug this cable into my 4K TV, I noticed a more sharper and vivid picture than before. So, if you are wondering if these cables are worth it since they&rsquo;re not priced at $50 or more like other name brands. I would say you need to buy these! They&rsquo;re high quality and you know that they will last a long time just by the feel of them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="atevon-hdmi-6-ft-cable">ATEVON HDMI 6 FT CABLE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am always finding a need for a good quality set of HDMI cables. I have Smart HD TV&rsquo;s, HD projectors, TV boxes, and several different game platforms that require this type of cable. I bought this cable because it covers everything I need in a HDMI cable. This cable is the perfect length. It&rsquo;s not too long and not too short. The connectors are made of pure copper and gold plates providing the ultimate continuity connection. Each end fits tight and snug. It&rsquo;s not going to move or fall out on it&rsquo;s own. The cord is sheathed with braided material making it very durable and twist resistant. This cord will definitely last longer than the other ones I own. This cord is also backed by a lifetime warranty which is another reason why I bought it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exceptional-cable-for-just-a-little-over-budget-cost">Exceptional cable for just a little over budget cost.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I stepped up to 4k and I wasn&rsquo;t sure about some of the older HDMI cables supporting that. I started looking around and doing some research. I found that it is recommended to use a 28awg wire for better signal strength, that removed most of the competition as they are only using 30awg wires. I say the ATEVON cables and was impressed. I read the reviews and was more impressed. I purchased the two pack of 6ft cables. On opening the box, they scream high quality. They have a very nice braid over the cable and beautiful finish on the connectors. They are twice the diameter of some of my budget cables yet still ran easily. Video and audio quality seem great. I would have to say the build quality more than surpasses the cost increase from a standard budget HDMI cable. My only two very minor negatives are that the braid collars came loose while installing the cables but I simply had to screw them down tight again. Also the connector face is a bit larger than average so I had to adjust some speaker wiring on the back of my receiver so it would fit in the port.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="thought-to-give-it-a-try-and-i-am-glad-i-ordered-it">&hellip; thought to give it a try and i am glad i ordered it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was hesitant first before but i thought to give it a try and i am glad i ordered it. Its a great product, used to connect my TV and Home theater system. The video quality is great with this product. Its 6 feet so helps me connect the appliance a little at distance too. Its definitely worth the price. Th HDMI cable connectors are also bright and good quality so durable product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-hdmi-cable">Great hdmi cable!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, an hdmi cable is an hdmi cable. Well, not all cables are made equal.This 6&rsquo; hdmi cable by ATEVON is a cut above. This cable is beefy. It isn&rsquo;t one of those cheap cables sold at the chain stores. This cable looks and feels like it should cost a lot more than it does. The video quality and everything is excellent and it will last a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-all-hdmi-are-created-the-same">Not all HDMI are created the same!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;HDMI cables are all created equal&rdquo; I call B.S. I bought a Sony Bravia, get it home to set everything up and the 4k from my PS4 Pro isn&rsquo;t recognized so I begin to search. As soon as I read about Premium HDMI I start searching Amazon. I bought 4 of these since I have 2 Bravia TVs with PS4 Pro so if anything does happen I&rsquo;ve got an immediate replacement&hellip;.. No more fighting with TV and PS4 Pro settings. They are sturdy, nice looking, 10 ft (all of my wires are run in the wall) and my kittens haven&rsquo;t tried to chew on them even though there is a bit outside the wall to the PS4. Oh, and an awesome warranty!</p>
