<h5 id="update-2-incredible-customer-service-replacement-received">UPDATE #2: Incredible customer service! Replacement received!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE #2:We received the replacement from the company, including a new and improved should strap which has better clips, is longer, and has a shoulder cushion which makes it much more comfortable. It also included a handwritten note from Renaldo thanking us for our business as well as making some lovely personal comments. Upgraded from 3 stars to 4. Very happy with this product and even happier with their service.UPDATE #1:After writing the below review I received a personal email from Renaldo. He was extremely concerned that we had a bad experience, and immediately acted to make it right. I&rsquo;m THRILLED with the level of service he&rsquo;s providing. I&rsquo;ve bumped my rating up to 3 stars from 2 stars.Once we receive the replacement bag I&rsquo;ll make another update here and hopefully get to raise it to a 4 or even 5-star rating.ORIGINAL:We really like this holder. Unfortunately the strap snapped off after a few days of normal use.</p>

<h5 id="good-water-bottle-pouch-with-some-compromises">Good Water Bottle Pouch (with some compromises)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A very good water bottle carrier. I wish that there was a drawstring to close the carrier against the water bottle, but I don&rsquo;t really need it. I&rsquo;m using it to carry a generic 32oz bottle and it&rsquo;s a nice, secure fit.The strap, on the other hand, is a disappointment. It&rsquo;s way too short. I&rsquo;m 6&rsquo; 2&rdquo; and if I try to use the strap to hang the bottle around my neck it thumps against the middle of my chest. The strap is too short to wear it cross-body over my shoulder, which would be my preference.Still, it was inexpensive and very good.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommend-this-water-bottle-carrier">Highly recommend this water bottle carrier!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice, very well made. Love the color choices. I bought blue and green. Our new Yeti water bottles fit in it perfectly and it looks like the seller will give exemplary customer service if anything ever goes wrong with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="well-made-serves-it-s-purpose">Well made, serves it’s purpose</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Where it’s great for walking around all day with a water bottle. I use a Contiga 32 ounce water bottle and it fits beautifully. I don’t have to keep juggling the water bottle in my hand all day when I met a fair or someplace like Disneyland.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-d-love-to-see-some-sort-of-stretchy-band-on-top">I’d love to see some sort of stretchy band on top &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Haven’t used this product yet, but it arrived exactly as it was described. I’d love to see some sort of stretchy band on top to hold to bottle in a little better if you are using this for hiking, but as I said the product is as described. I gave 3 stars because of the flaw I mentioned. The top of the holder is a little flimsy if you are using this for hiking, I cut a few holes and threaded a piece of shock cord to create a more secure top to the holder so my water wouldn’t fall out on a hike.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="sturdy-enough-for-my-day-hikes">Sturdy enough for my day hikes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Sturdy enough for my day hikes. I only carry 12 or 16 oz bottles of water and clip my keys to the plastic ring. Good to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yup-it-keeps-my-water-bottle-cold">Yup! It keeps my water bottle cold</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s perfect! But I expect that from MEK. The transaction was easy and smooth. But I expect that from MEK. Shipping was lightning fast! But I expect that from Amazon Prime.</p>
