<h5 id="a-worthy-upgrade-from-plasma">A worthy upgrade from plasma</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all let me qualify by saying I didn&rsquo;t need a new TV as my Samsung Plasma has been working absolutely fine for the last 5 years. However after checking out the new TVs at Best Buy for a friend, I was intrigued by this particular TV and model. The colors and black levels were better than all the TVs on display in the store.Amazon came through as always matching the price of the lowest online retailer I could find. Funny sidenote, in the last 12 years, all my TVs were purchased from Amazon and I have not had 1 complaint. The TV was delivered 4 days before the ETA shown on Amazon&rsquo;s website. It was delivered by Pilot Freight Services. Two guys brought the TV in and they set everything up and powered on to make sure its all fine.On to the TV itself, as soon as you turn it on and it goes through the initial setup you know you are in for a treat. Out of the box, the colors look so vibrant and the cartoonish setup process is a lot of fun especially if you have little kids around. As soon as the TV connected to the internet it found an update and installed it. I am kind of a stickler when it comes to calibration so I did intensive research online to get the best settings possible. I found a setting on avsforums that everybody raved about so I used that as the base and ran the Picture Wizard III to get the picture just the way I wanted. I also ditched the magic remote despite the coolness factor and programmed my logitech harmony One remote to include this TV.My basic setup is as follows;My Xbox One, PS4, Gaming PC connected to my Denon 2113CI AVR which then sends the output to the HDMI1 port on the TV. Per some recommendations, I renamed the HDMI1 port as PC which is supposed to reduce lag. I popped in a few Blu-Ray movies to test. I am a 3D aficionado so obviously the first movies I tried were Gravity, Avatar, Avengers, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 and Life of PI. I was impressed by the 3D. there was almost zero crosstalk and the glasses we got from the theater screening of Avengers 2 worked fine, so we didn&rsquo;t bother with the glasses that came with the TV. I really liked the clip-on glasses. It was a nice touch since I wear regular glasses.I played a few games next like GTAV and Total War Atilla on the PC, Shadows of Mordor on the Xbox One and Drive Club on the PS4. In Drive Club the colors really shown it was like watching a live race. In GTAV the night scnes were so dark and detailed it was like playing a totally new game.My regular TV broadcast is through Dish which is connected through my Xbox One. The broadcasts were all over the place. Some of the Sports were very nice to look at but some of the shows had plenty of distortion and foggy pictures.Watching stuff on Netflix and Amazon Prime was a treat as it really shined through especially animations like Avengers Assemble and Ultimate Spiderman.Overall I am in love with this TV, Its pretty much the best you can score for the budget conscious crowd and I am not too worried about its future proofing as the 4K standards are still evolving and have not been finalized.</p>

<h5 id="truly-is-as-good-as-advertised">Truly is as good as advertised!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good:• Absolutely stunning looking – even when it is OFF. Okay, I will admit, the first thing I feel in love with on this TV is its looks. It is like the pretty girl who walks by…. She makes you turn your head! Even the stand for the TV has the cool factor to it. Then you look at the profile and your jaw drops even more (opposite reason of the well-proportioned girl). That pencil thin screen is hard to believe at first. One word to describe the general looks of this TV: SEXY!• OLED\Picture quality: Okay, the reason you don’t just keep walking after looking at the TV. The beautiful image on the screen. I went to several brick and mortar stores to check out the TV. Wisely they have the perfect loop of images going on the screen. Everything had black backgrounds which really makes the foreground objects POP. My prior TV was a high end Plasma, so it didn’t blow me away as much as others, but I was still very impressed! If you prior experience is with LCD/LED’s – be prepared to have your mind blown. True blacks really make the difference on both dark and bright images. It builds in a sense of depth to the pictures and image sharpness. Everything I have watched on this TV, just looks better!• Sidenote on picture quality: I had a technical issue with one of my DirecTV receivers. DirecTV had to come out and replace it. The technician stopped and his jaw dropped when he saw the screen. He asked me what kind of TV it was. Said it was the best picture he had ever seen. His interest was sincere and he asked a ton of questions. Keep in mind – this is someone in and out of homes all day looking at people’s different TV’s. Confirmed my opinion and decision ;-)• Gaming – have not tried it yet, but super excited about ability to have multi player using the same TV sharing the same full screen.• WebOS: This was the biggest surprise to me and next to the picture, my favorite feature. I almost don’t need my Amazon Fire TV anymore. WebOS has almost every app I need native and in some instances BETTER versions of them. My primary apps are NetFlix (love WebOS version), Amazon Video, and an app called Smart Share. If you are someone who likes to stream their own media (photos, music, and video)…. This is the app for you. It found my DNLA server right away and I was off and running. No longer needed an application like Kodi or Plex to stream. Great surprise and I almost missed it. Didn’t even know it was there and was just clicking buttons on the menu ;-) Overall, I highly concur with all the professional reviews I read – LG leap frogged the market with WebOS and they are going to be playing catch up this year. Ton more I could say on the topic, but these are the highlights.• Motion Blur. Played a couple of action games on my Amazon Fire TV and watch a lot of the sports on the TV so far. I have not noticed ANY motion blur. But to be honest, I’m not super sensitive to it either.Bads:• Not 4K. Yes, would have been nice to have the FEATURE there for future proofing. I know they added it to the FY15 model. To me it is an oversight and was the one thing that made me hesitate with this TV (besides the price). I know I don’t need 4K now, but in 5 years am I going to wish I had it? I don’t think so. In 7-10 yes, but I will be replacing this TV by year 7 most likely anyways.• Magic Remote: Could have put this on the GOOD. But there are two things that drive me nuts about this thing. One, no numbers. If I am on channel 2 and I want to go to channel 231…. I have to either a) have it as one of my 9 allowed DirecTV favorites b) scroll through every channel to get there, or c) get out the DirecTV remote. I noticed that the new version of the Magic remote has numbers…. But sadly, it is not compatible with this TV. Second – while it controls MOST of the DirecTV functions, it does not turn it on and off with the TV. Maybe I’m just too spoiled to universal remotes. On the good side – once you take 2 or 3 minutes, you get use to the mouse cursor and learn to really like it. Makes skipping around in movies much easier.Neutral:• Curved. Yes, it is a gimmick and doesn’t really add much to the viewing experience. Maybe adds a little to the cool looking factor, but when watching TV, you won’t even notice it. I will say of all the curved TV’s I have seen, this one has the least amount of curve. Pretty minimal actually. If the curve look bugs you, take a look in person before you dismiss.• Passive 3D. I put this under natural simply because I don’t care. I know some people prefer Active 3D while others like Passive. I did watch Gravity and Avatar 3D on this TV. Yes, couple of scenes are really cool – especially in Avatar. But the loss in picture quality of any 3D movie bugs me. So I suspect I will almost never use it.• Price: I started looking at this TV when it was $3500. Just could not justify that for a 55 inch. But with the $1000 drop in price, I think they hit their sweet spot. Yes, you can get a very nice 65 inch for $2000, but it won’t have the same picture quality. Not even with 4K</p>
