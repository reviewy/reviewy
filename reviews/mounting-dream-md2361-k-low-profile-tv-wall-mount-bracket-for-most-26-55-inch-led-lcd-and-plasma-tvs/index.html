<h5 id="not-as-advertised-but-greatest-service-recovery-ever">Not as advertised (But greatest service recovery ever!)</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(READ BELOW FOR UPDATE!)Installation was pretty uneventful. Instructions were precise and package provides for every mounting possibility. Came different sized screws and spacers which was impressive. Also came with a magnetic level, but I ended up using a my larger (reliable) level. Once bracket was mounted, got tv up in the wall in no time. For the price, a really sweet deal. Now the reason I knocked off two stars, wall mount piece in picture was different from what I received. Mine only had 4 screwholes on each edge and 4 adjustable screwholes towards the middle. With the way my studs are located I had to move the mount 3 inches from the center since the edge screw holes are not adjustable, they&rsquo;re just holes on each edge. I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s an older version I received. Yes I know there are several remedies to fix that shortcoming, like mounting a piece of plywood to the studs then attaching the mount to the plywood.In the end, took me about half hour with all the measuring and adjusting I had to do to accommodate this product&rsquo;s shortcoming. Would have been much easier I received the unit pictured instead. But once installed, tv was pretty solid with very minimal wobbling. Decided to mount my kids tv as well, but will look to purchase something else.UPDATE: I was contacted by Mounting Dream after posting this review and I gotta say they&rsquo;ve provided the best service recovery I&rsquo;ve ever seen. They now have my loyalty for sure! They were very nice in offering an explanation and offered to replace the said bracket. I explained to them there&rsquo;s no more need since I mounted it already. Never been more impressed by a seller trying to make things right. I totally appreciate sellers I&rsquo;ll definitely recommend Mounting Dream to everyone I know!</p>

<h5 id="deck-garage-portable-tv-stand">Deck / Garage Portable TV Stand</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Needed an inexpensive way to mount an old flat screen TV for portable use on the deck or in garage. This fit the bill! Made a portable stand from2 x 4s. (See pictures.) Stand easily moved to a new location via 2-wheeler. While the square bracket of this wall mount was not long enough for my TV, I was able to cut in half and make it so. However, they do come in bigger sizes so do your research and order the right size. Plenty of holes in this mount for giving yourself some flexibility for a custom job. Wall mount bracket good and sturdy. No concern about moving this around and loosing the TV. TV can be dismounted by pulling on two straps to allow lifting off the bracket if needed. IMPORTANT - While not shown in the pictures a couple pieces of wood were added to keep the TV from moving side to side and sliding off bracket. A handle also added to wood frame to aid in portability. DISCLAIMER - I pass this along for informational purposes only. If you do this, it is at your own risk. I am not responsible for your lack of construction ability or broken TV.</p>

<h5 id="it-looks-great-i-feel-great">It Looks Great! I Feel Great!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I received the TV Wall Mount from Mountain Dream. Unfortunately, the spacing of my wall studs is 24 inches which is beyond the 16 inch capacity of this product. PLEASE make sure to measure your stud spacing before buying ANY mount, not just this one. Most mounts only cover 16 inches so the mount specs and stud spacing needs to be verified before purchase. I was upset that mount did not match my needs so I left a bad review, I shouldn’t have been so quick, because it was not entirely Mountain Dreams fault, 16 inches is relatively standard.The good folks at Mountain Dream contacted me shortly after I received their mount and they worked with me to get my TV up. They really went above and beyond to not only get this TV up but also to get it setup low profile, I did not want it sticking to far from the wall. I really appreciate all their technical support and courteous emails. I am gladly changing my review of them and their product to as good as it gets. The mount is a bargain to begin with but the mount followed by their stellar support makes it the bargain of the century (well, maybe not a century but at least the best deal I have had all year). I recommend this mount to anyone needing a no frills, low-pro mount that is solid and safe.</p>

<h5 id="will-not-work-with-vizio-32-or-39-led-tvs">Will not work with Vizio 32&rdquo; or 39&rdquo; LED TVs</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent mount, but does not include the necessary hardware for mounting Vizio 32&rdquo; or 39&rdquo; LED TVs. The mounting kit includes screw sizes M5, M6, and M8 but not size M4, which is required for Vizio 32 and 39 models. (see attached diagram from Vizio installation guide) I had to run around town to several hardware stores to find the screws I needed, which made the whole process a much bigger hassle than it needed to be.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-me">Works for Me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used these for my third and fourth mounting projects. Sturdy, effective, simple, and I love the little handles in case you need to take the TV down, even if they do tend to hang down. A different, costlier brand I used before required you to secure the bottom by turning screws that had to be reached with a long phillips screwdriver from underneath the TV and within the inch or so of space available between the TV and the wall. Very discouraging if you just needed to take the set down to add some cables or whatever. If you don&rsquo;t need to tilt the TV or turn it side-to-side, these are a perfectly good and very inexpensive way to get an appropriately sized TV hung up.</p>

<h5 id="great-mount-for-the-money">Great mount for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very good mount for the money. I mounted a 43&rdquo; Roku (TCL) TV with no issues. For the money, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer. Mounts close to the wall but not so tight that install is a problem. My only complaint, and the reason for 4 stars rather than 5, is the lack of a set screw or other mechanism to lock the mount in place with respect to lateral movement. When plugging devices into the side of the TV it wants to slide. I&rsquo;m sure I could somehow modify the mount to lock it where I want it, but a better solution would habe been a top-mounted set screw on each horizontal arm. No big deal, just FYI. I would absolutely buy this again.</p>
