<h5 id="great-for-beginners">Great for beginners!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Comes with everything shown (though items may look slighty different), simple to use, takes great pictures, I all around love it! It&rsquo;s a good deal for everything that you get. (It also includes a camera neck strap, and lens for your camera). I do recommend getting one!</p>

<h5 id="which-itself-is-very-good-and-an-excellent-value">which itself is very good and an excellent value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is more on the accessories than the camera, which itself is very good and an excellent value. It&rsquo;s very easy to use, and the only thing I had trouble with so far is putting the neck strap on. But enough of that, lets talk about what comes with it.First things first is the camera bag. It&rsquo;s much smaller than I was expecting, and it&rsquo;s a tight fit especially after I put a different, thicker strap on the camera. You can cram most of the accessories that came with the camera into the bag (except the battery charger, which is too bulky), but there is little to no organization.Next is the XTech Starter Kit. This is a sealed bag with lens cleaner, q-tips, a cleaning cloth, a squeegee card, the memory card wallet, the mini table tripod, and 2 universal screen protectors. And right off the bat there was a problem as the spray bottle of cleaner had leaked out into the bag. Most of the items were sealed in their own plastic wrapping, but I had to dry off the wallet and the tripod. And the squeegee was a total loss. The min tripod is good and goes on easy to the camera. the wallet is what it is- big enough to hold three SD cards.The full size tripod is excellent. You can set it up in a few minutes, and it&rsquo;s very sturdy. It folds down into a very small package, and it comes with it&rsquo;s own carrying bag.The USB SD Card reader is a bit bulky, so prepare to loose more than one USB port or other port next to it when you plug it in. Other than that, it functions perfectly.The 32 Gig SD card seems to be functioning normally; I look forward to finding out how much I can store on it before I need to switch the card out for a fresh one.I have not tested the battery charger or the batteries, as the camera comes with four brand new Duracell&rsquo;s in the box. Also in the box with the camera is a regular Nikon strap, so don&rsquo;t feel you need to buy one separately unless you want a padded strap for your neck.All in all I&rsquo;d say this is a decent value, though I will be buying a new case soon.</p>
