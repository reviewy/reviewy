<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this almost daily for a couple of months and like it, but I don&rsquo;t love it. I had an amazon dual car charger that I was fairly happy with, but we needed a car charger for the back of our van, so I decided to move the amazon one to the back of the car and to get a smart-charger for the front of the car, since I use it a lot and wanted something that would possibly charge faster (not that I thought the amazon charger was slow or anything..I just wanted to upgrade). So I got this. It charges pretty quickly&hellip;my husband remarked that it charges faster than his car&rsquo;s USB slots. The only problem I have with this is it tends to slip out a little, so I find that about 30% of the time I plug my phone in, I have to push it back into the socket to connect my phone to power. That, of course, means that I have to check the connection every time I plug it in (my iphone sometimes doesn&rsquo;t ding when it starts charging, especially when I use the car chargers&hellip;don&rsquo;t know why that is). This is an issue that I did not have with the amazon charger&hellip;once that one was plugged in, it was in there tight. This one, not so much. It&rsquo;s not the biggest deal in the world, so I&rsquo;m fairly happy with this charger, but it does take it down a star.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>UPDATE: Anker contacted me a couple days later and promised me a completely fixed unit. 2 days later I see a package in the mailbox. I didn&rsquo;t hesitant to throw it on the electronic load and plug it into the car for a good drive. Lo and behold, everything is fixed. The center spring was less &ldquo;springy&rdquo; the side springs were hard as a rock, and the thermal design was much better. At 10v 3 amps the charger is equally hot (a good thing because the heat is actually getting out of the plastic case). It held a constant 4.8 amps at 5.03 volts for 8 hours. The charger is working fine without even picking up a screwdriver. Anker still hasn&rsquo;t failed me yet, words from a long time customer studying electrical engineering.To start, I need to explain why it is getting 3 stars. The charger is built extremely well on the component level, but Anker&rsquo;s customer service and the lack of attention to detail semi ruined this charger for me. Let me explain what happened.I bought the charger and it came in a week, pretty ridiculous when i&rsquo;m located in the same state as Anker&rsquo;s shipping dept. I have Prime, but this isn&rsquo;t a prime item.Then I plugged it into my car, all works fine didn&rsquo;t notice anything. Drove around and my phone started to vibrate like crazy, after some searching around, I found out that the center spring was way too strong. The side springs are too weak, and its making intermittent contact with the 12v socket.I asked on Amazon if anyone has had this issue, and sure enough some people did. So I contacted Anker at support@ianker.comThey said I will need to ship it back, then when they receive it, they send another one. The turn around time was too long so I tried to just return it on Amazon. They didn&rsquo;t let me so I called Amazon customer service. They refunded my money and let me keep the charger.Instead of letting it go to waste, I wanted to fix it. So here is the charger in pieces and under some extreme testing.You can see the Input voltage of the charger I put at its min voltage of 10v. It draws quite a bit of current. 3.07 amps which turns into 30.5 watts going into the charger. However only ~25watts come out. You can pretty much calculate the efficiency right there at around Efficiency = (Vout*Iout)/Vin*Iin Which turn out a 82.2%You have to trust me here but I did the same test on the high end, 24volts. The efficiency was 81.8%The design and layout of the circuitry is not bad at all, although i couldn&rsquo;t find a datasheet on the main chip MPSF14/M5402M, everything else is quite high quality. You have a good quality solid state capacitor, which is rated 2000 hours at 105C. I have done a burn in test with this charger. 12 hours at full load. It got extremely hot but it&rsquo;s all working still.Modifications I have done,Cut the center spring 2mm shorter, cover the whole inside with thermal pads, to actually get the heat out. But I have to give Anker credit for the small piece of white thermal pad already in there.Build quality is pretty nice, the inductor is siliconed, solder joints looks good.Bottomline is, if this charger fits your car. Then your golden, if not and you don&rsquo;t know how to take it apart. Then your screwed.FYI Both the Anker 4 port 48w and the old 24w power iq fit in my car&rsquo;s 12v socket.</p>

<p>Love this charger! No weird noises, doesn&rsquo;t over heat, and looks great. On top of that, the company is very customer oriented and is willing to keep the buyer happy even if the customer didn&rsquo;t like the product (though I wouldn&rsquo;t know who would).<strong>UPDATE</strong>Unfortunately I spoke to soon about customer service. I tried reaching out via email and have not heard from them. Great product, but customer service :/<strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong>Anker customer support has been making an effort to make my experience buying with them better, so for that I had to come and re-update my review. I&rsquo;ve seen faster customer support but nonetheless they&rsquo;ve gone out there way and have convinced me they want to make their customers happy :)</p>

<h5 id="the-first-one-i-ordered-was-defective-but-still-five-stars">The first one I ordered was defective..but still five stars!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>*Update!*After writing my first review I was promptly contacted by Anker; they told me that I had received a defective unit. Anker promptly arranged for a replacement to be sent. I could not have asked for better customer service. Anker is once again one of my favorite brands for electronic accessories and will certainly be buying more of their products in the future. If Anker&rsquo;s customer support is still reading these reviews thank you once again.The charger works great. It quickly charges any phone that I have tired with it and looks great with the red nylon covered micro USB cables that Anker also sells that I had bought at the same time. Seems like this going to be a very durable charger and it is very compact. It is nice to see that I can just replace the usb cables since they seem to be the part that usually breaks when it comes to car chargers.This is a great looking product and seems to be designed very well. I have been extremely happy with all of the other Anker brand products that I have bought in the past but this adapter has on annoying issue. It seems to slip out of the 12v power adapter and cigarette lighters that I have used it in. So when I get in my car and plug my phone in I assume it is charging but it is usually not which is quite frustrating.</p>
