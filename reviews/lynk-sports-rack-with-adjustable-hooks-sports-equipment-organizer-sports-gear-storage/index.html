<h5 id="perfect-for-sports-organization-but-lacking-in-quality">Perfect for sports organization but lacking in quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was sick of having all our sports gear sprinkled throughout the garage. I looked at a lot of different options for balls, rackets and bats and didn&rsquo;t find anything that seemed to work and kept coming back to this. I finally decided to make the purchase as there weren&rsquo;t any other options that hit the mark for the organization. When it arrived I was disappointed with the quality of the pieces. The plastic is very cheap and flimsy. Lucky for me I have a very handy husband who was able to get it together and hung. We put basketballs, soccer balls, footballs and a couple of baseballs on the ball racks. The hooks on the side held the baseball bat just fine and we hung life vests on the hooks. This will work great until a kid grabs onto it a little too hard and then it will be done for. If the manufacturer made a durable version of this product it would be 5 stars and I would recommend it to every soccer mom I know.I&rsquo;d give it 5 stars for organization and 1 star for quality giving it a solid 3 stars.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="pretty-good-for-the-mone-y">Pretty good for the mone y.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall, not bad for a $25 (or so) rack. Assembly was easy. The only issue I had were the 4 bat hooks that hang on the side (2 on each side). They attach with a built in plastic push clip - one broke. So I cut the rest of the clip off, filed it flat, and used a <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>64</sub> bit to drill a hole in the middle of where the push clip was. Reattached with a small <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&rdquo; long screw (#6 size maybe? They were leftovers in my misc screws bin) and #8 washer. My repair felt sturdier than the factory clips, so I ripped the other 3 off and did the same with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-assemble-but-be-careful-putting-on-the-side">Easy to assemble but be careful putting on the side &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to assemble but be careful putting on the side racket hooks. The first four all broke off before the rack was even mounted. Lynk sports was very responsive and sent me replacements which are working well. Suggest putting these on last after mounting the rest of the rack to the wall. Functionally, the rack works really well at organizing all our small sports equipment.. I&rsquo;m so glad I&rsquo;m not chasing the basket balls down the driveway anymore.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-way-to-organize-sport-equipment">Great way to organize sport equipment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As others have mentioned it is bigger than it looks. The assembly went smoothly. Having read the comments about the plastic breaking during assembly I used a wooden block to place between the hammer and the plastic to distribute the force. I tapped rather hard during assembly and did not break the plastic.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="garage-ocd-approved">Garage OCD approved</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very easy to put together. We will see if it holds up to the kids pulling on it when getting the balls down. Seems to be durable enough though so far. I wish it came with somewhere to hang skateboard because that doesn&rsquo;t fit but Good buy, just wish I ordered two!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-product-is-fantastic">This product is fantastic!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite some of the reviews I decided to buy it for my tween son. It was shipped to me quickly. When it arrived I tried putting it together, but I struggled some (I&rsquo;m not the greatest at putting things together) so I let my husband take over. He had no issues putting it together. It holds a lot of stuff and doesn&rsquo;t take up too much space. The only reason I didn&rsquo;t give it 5 stars was because I had a hard time assembling it, and I wish the bottom rack was large enough to hold more larger sized balls (more basketballs) but I can use the lower rack for my son&rsquo;s basketball shoes instead. So to sum it up: great product for the price, is really sturdy if put together properly, holds a lot of stuff, and keeps my house free of basketballs being tripping hazards.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="handy">Handy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Handy. This was perfect for organizing all the sports gear we have. I did not have any difficulties with the plastic hooks that I read of in other reviews though could see that happening. The major complaint I have with the rack is that everything is made with cheap materials. It&rsquo;s doing a great job organizing our stuff for now but does not seem like something that will last for an extra-long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-rack">Great Rack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Went together very easily and does what I was expecting. We use it for bicycle helmets on the racks and hang my sons baseball bags from the hooks. Frame and hooks are plastic and tubes are aluminum.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="multiple-sport-mama">Multiple sport mama!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Holds lots of stuff! Great for kids in multiple sports. I hung it high enough to put a little bench underneath and it’s working out well!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-sports-rack">Nice sports rack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nice sports rack. Like that it provides easy access to all the halls at once. Other systems use a chute style organization which means you have to cycle through balls to select.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-doesn-t-seem-like-a-sturdy-sports-rack">It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a sturdy sports rack</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t seem like a sturdy sports rack, but the installation was easy, it comes with everything you need, and has been hanging on my garage wall for a few months loaded up with&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>held up perfect in garage only complain is the side doesnt hold much. raquets fits kind of awkard.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The worst quality. I would never recomend this item.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="ahhhh-organization-gods-are-pleased">Ahhhh!!! Organization gods are pleased!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So happy!!! Cleared up my garage and looks great!!! Tired of husband losing his balls all over the place. Hahahahahaha.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for holding kids sports gear. Easy to put together and install on wall.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>cheap feel to it / not very structurally sound</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars-1">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not the most robust construction but does the job.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-this-helped-organize-our-garage-it-looks">Works great! This helped organize our garage &amp; it looks &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great! This helped organize our garage &amp; it looks nice. The bars are NOT that strong - they will bend if pressure is put on it.</p>
