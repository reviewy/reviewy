<h5 id="easy-to-setup">Easy to setup</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I set this up on my Alexa and the Kasa app in less than 30 minutes start to finish. I noticed that sometimes I would say the command, &ldquo;Alexa turn on lamp,&rdquo; and Alexa would respond &ldquo;ok&rdquo; without actually turning anything on. The issue was my 5-year-old router. I replaced the router with a new router that could handle more devices. The new router resolved the issue. I&rsquo;ve been using this plug for a few months now and it is still working great.</p>

<h5 id="love-it-here-is-a-hint-for-echo-owners">Love it! Here is a hint for Echo owners</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The new Echo compatibility works very well and allows grouping controllers under a single group name. I just set up three controllers and now I can say &ldquo;Alexa, turn on the living room lights&rdquo; and viola, they&rsquo;re on! Much easier than finding each lamp&rsquo;s on/off switch on a cord behind a piece of furniture. I can also schedule them to turn on and off when we&rsquo;re away from home.Go to the TP-LINK support site for full instructions and to the Alexa app if you&rsquo;re using an Echo to control the switches. The set up was mostly straight forward once I read the TP-LINK full instructions, but below is an more detailed hint for part of the instructions that weren&rsquo;t clear to me at first. I spent about 30 minutes puzzling this out, but the rest was fast and easy.The controllers can be configured with Kasa to be &ldquo;local&rdquo; or &ldquo;remote&rdquo; connected. To be controlled by Echo each individual controller must be set to Remote Control ON, in the Device Settings menu. That menu is accessed in Kasa with this process after the controller is initially set up: From Kasa&rsquo;s home page tap the device name; a screen for that device appears, with selections for Schedule, Away, Timer, an off/on button and at the top right corner an icon that looks like three little sliders. Tap that icon to open the Device Settings screen and then slide the Remote Control slider icon to the right so that it lights green. Do that for all controllers you want to be controlled through Echo.</p>

<p>TP-LINK Wi-Fi Smart Plug HS100 ReviewA couple of weeks ago, I purchased a Smart Plug (HS100) to confirm that the product works with Alexa (Amazon Echo) and provides easy, reliable, secure remote control of plugged-in devices. Pros and cons are below.If you use consumer Wi-Fi (IP) webcams (Foscam, etc.), then you may be familiar with this product&rsquo;s technology and potential concerns about security and privacy. A webcam contains a microprocessor which can be programmed (with network data, operational settings and user options) and controls a camera which may be monitored using an app. A Smart Plug contains a microprocessor which can be programmed and controls a power switch which may be monitored using an app. Both local (LAN) and remote (Internet WAN) control are possible in each case.After confirming that the Plug indeed works as advertised, I was more curious about how and where operational data (supplied via the app) is stored and secured. That is, I&rsquo;m not sure if all operational data is stored on-board the Plug in non-volatile memory in case of extended power outages and to secure such data locally. If remote control is used, what&rsquo;s stored in TP-LINK&rsquo;s Cloud server?[A Vine Voice review on 1-23-2016 indicated that &ldquo;the plug has internal storage for its own status and the schedule. &hellip; a copy of the schedule is stored in the plug itself and does not rely on having a persistent internet connection to function. &hellip; plug does rely on the power to keep time so that it can act on scheduled events.&rdquo;]If the Plug is like a Wi-Fi webcam, then operational data is stored on-board, as can be verified using a local web browser connection to the camera&rsquo;s built-in web server. A Smart Plug, however, does not provide browser access, whether it runs a web server or not [there is a http port]. Remotely using a manufacturer&rsquo;s app, whether for a camera or Plug, introduces Cloud-based data storage and collection.And because Wi-Fi webcams and Smart Plugs are computers, they can crash or glitch and need to be reset. That&rsquo;s why reliability is a key factor. Time will tell. The Plug has a 2 year warranty.So, setup was relatively easy, and I discovered (as other reviewers have noted) that the best (but not perfect) instructions are in the Support section of TP-LINK&rsquo;s website, rather than in the included Quick Start Guide.* * <em>[&hellip;]How to connect my TP-LINK Smart Plug to my home network via Kasa?How to make my TP-LINK Smart Plug work with Amazon Echo?</em> * *1. Install the &ldquo;Kasa&rdquo; app on your iPhone.2. Open Kasa. If you want to use the Smart Plug with Alexa (Remote Control), setup a TP-LINK (Cloud / P2P registry server) account; and, after receiving an email activation message, login; otherwise, you may Skip setting up an account for just local control.3. With your iPhone on a local 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi connection, open Kasa and then: (a) plug Smart Plug into an AC outlet; (b) Add Device &gt; SMART PLUG and follow the instructions; &copy; which say to go to your iPhone&rsquo;s Wi-Fi settings and connect to the Smart Plug&rsquo;s Wi-Fi network and then return to Kasa; (d) customize your Plug &ndash; with a unique name, etc.; and (e) connect the Plug to your local Wi-Fi (with or without Remote Control, but Alexa requires Remote Control enabled).To use a Smart Plug with Alexa:A. On your iPhone in the Alexa app settings (via &ldquo;hamburger&rdquo; icon), tap on Smart Home and then the TP-LINK Kasa item and login with your TP-LINK (Cloud) account name and password.B. Scroll down Smart Home and near the bottom tap Discover devices (search your Wi-Fi LAN) to add your named Smart Plug, which will then be listed.C. With Alexa, say &ldquo;Turn on / off (name of plug).&ldquo;Pros• Good package and product design (both hardware and app).• Works with Alexa without a hub.• Setup relatively easy.• WiFi connectivity provides 2-way communication for control and real-time status (unlike one-way powerline modules).• Remote access without router configuration (port forwarding) [probably using company&rsquo;s (or subcontractor&rsquo;s) Cloud / P2P server like most Wi-Fi cameras].• 15A load max.• Can unplug from AC without losing settings in order to relocate unit.• Moderate price.• TP-LINK supportive with comments on Amazon reviews.• 2 year warranty.Minor Cons• No support for 5 GHz Wi-Fi (okay as long as most routers are dual band).• Plug socket on front rather than the side or bottom (like on X-10 modules) of unit &ndash; cord protrudes even farther from wall.• Status LED always on &ndash; no way to turn off (like on Sonos speakers).• With Alexa, limited to only commands to turn on / off.Cons• Size (see photos) &ndash; bulkier than standard X-10 appliance module (longer and thicker); even thicker than X-10 Pro appliance module and around the same length.• Covers both outlets if plugged into bottom outlet; covers upper edge of bottom outlet if plugged into top outlet, making bottom outlet unusable.Concerns• UL certificationSome reviewers were worried about UL certification (which is not marked on the product or box). The manufacturer stated that certification was obtained. I searched UL&rsquo;s Online Certifications Directory (database) and found a listing: XACN.E481494 Miscellaneous Controls Operating Control, Smart Plug, Model(s) HS100, HS110 Last Updated on 2016-03-29.• Heat buildup when connected to some (high wattage) appliancesSome reviewers were worried about the Plug getting too warm. I have only connected LED lamps (~10 W) to the Plug so far; so, I cannot as yet comment on possible thermal issues. The manufacturer stated that the Plug &ldquo;will remain well within a safe temperature range.&ldquo;• Security and use of encryption, e.g., protection of data stored in Plug&rsquo;s memory and TP-LINK&rsquo;s Cloud.The manufacturer stated: &ldquo;In order to control your Smart Plug remotely, a TP-LINK Cloud Account is required. Your Cloud Account is safe and secured, and remote access to your Smart Plug is controlled solely by you through the Kasa App. Cloud accounts and Cloud servers are an industry standard for Smart Plugs and Smart Home devices.&rdquo;&ldquo;The Smart Plug does not hand over or transmit any password information to us; It receives Wi-Fi profile information from your phone during setup, in order to connect the Smart Plug to your router.&ldquo;• Privacy (privacy trade-offs)The weighty Terms of Use and Privacy Policy pose questions about data collection and sharing of personal data, anonymized or not &ndash; for marketing &amp; promotion, including partners and other 3rd parties. &ldquo;Device submissions&rdquo; &hellip; device names, groups, schedules, locations, &hellip;&ldquo;usage information&rdquo; &hellip;Software limitations• No offset possible on sunrise and sunset timer, but can use Away mode for randomness.Questions1. Security: Is Wi-Fi password saved only in Plug&rsquo;s memory or also in TP-LINK&rsquo;s Cloud? Encrypted?2. Security: Are timers, schedule, Away settings stored in Plug&rsquo;s memory or the Cloud? Encrypted?3. Plugs do NOT communicate with each other, correct? Only with the TP-LINK Cloud?4. When the unit is unplugged from AC outlet, are all settings (defined using the Kasa app) truly non-volatile? Does the on-board clock re-synchronize via Wi-Fi on the LAN anyway when plugged into AC again?UPDATE 6-13-2016Purchased another 2 Smart Plugs on June 3. New packaging has UL certification mark, as well as new graphics and description: old &ldquo;Wi-Fi SMART PLUG&rdquo; vs. new &ldquo;Smart Wi-Fi Plug;&rdquo; old FC and RoHS marks vs. new UL and RoHS marks; model and part number unchanged.</p>
