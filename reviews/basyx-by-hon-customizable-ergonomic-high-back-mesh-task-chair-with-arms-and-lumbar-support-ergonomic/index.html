<blockquote>
<p>With two home offices, and as facilities manager at my company, I have purchased and assembled a lot of office chairs. I am especially familiar with Hon and their Basyx line, having recently acquired this exact chair in an all leather model. While my wife likes the plush leather, I prefer the coolness of mesh, which is why I decided to get this chair.It arrives well protected (see photo) and ready for assembly. It consists of all the standard parts (see photo): casters and leg frame, hydraulic cylinder, arms, a multi-lever adjuster assembly (see close up photo), a package of hardware with hex wrench, a cloth upholstered seat, and the mesh back (see photo of the parts). The assembly instructions were clear and easy to follow, again, pretty standard for this type of chair: put casters on legs, insert cylinder, attach arms and control assembly to seat, put the whole thing onto leg assembly, attach back, and sit on it. Like its sister product, the assembly is made easier by being able to put the seat on the legs before attaching the back, avoiding having to lift the whole chair onto the legs. I timed the assembly and it took 18 minutes, even while drinking a beer.The finished product looks professional (see photo). Arm height, tilt, seat to back angle, and chair height are all adjustable. I had everything comfortable in just a few dozen seconds. The mesh back is very supportive and forgiving, and for me, it is shaped just right to provide good lumbar support without feeling like it is trying to push me over. The chair moves easily on the sturdy casters, and I appreciate the height adjustable arms, which allow me to go higher on the right side to support my arm with elbow tendonitis while keeping the other armrest out of the way on my left side. It’s a great ergonomic consideration.I recommend this chair to just about everybody, because it is so easy to put together, so easy to use, and so comfortable to sit in. Of course, the wide range of possible adjustments really makes these Hon Basyx chairs standout. As I said in my other chair review, for a professional working person’s office where functionality and comfort are important, this is a five-star chair.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="helps-with-my-seating-posture">Helps with my seating posture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The HON Basyx chair has the features and the trendy look of a high-end office/home office chair. I have been through several construction/building expansion projects in the last few years and had the privilege of working with many office furniture vendors, including HON. This chair offers the same great features you would expect from a modern furniture piece. There are several factors that typically affect the price of an office chair: warranty, number of features, and upholstery durability. Unfortunately, I could not find any information of this chair&rsquo;s number of rubs. Here&rsquo;s why I find it important.When choosing a chair, you would look for a fabric that will hold up to the intended use which is determined by how it rates on the double rub test. The test is a back and forth motion on the fabric that approximates the wear and tear that happens when furniture is sat upon. 3,000 double rubs equal one year’s worth of use. In the ideal situation, you would look at 30,000 or more double rubs. In a commercial setting 100,000; 250,000 and even 500,000 rubs are considered for places like call centers, nurse stations, etc. The chairs often come with a 12 year warranty.To my surprise, HON Basyx comes with a 5-year warranty, which should be ideal for a typical home office, 2-3 hours of computer use per day. We tend to retire a chair after 2 or three years of moderate use in our household due to only two reasons: the pneumatic mechanism dies or the cushioning becomes too flat for the chair to be used comfortably. Considering the offered 5 year warranty, and its reasonable cost, this chair is already a winner in my book.The HON Basyx was extremely easy to install and took me no more than 5 minutes. Right out of the box, I noticed the heavy duty features of the main seat adjustment mechanism. It offers height adjustment, tilt adjustment of both the seat and the back, back height adjustment, arm height adjustment, as well as 360 degree swivel.Here&rsquo;s where I personally find HON Basyx a lot less comfortable that a chair I use at work. Neither the seat, nor the back recline as far back as I would typically prefer. However, the positive aspect of such limitation is that the chair controls my posture superbly. It keeps my back straight, there&rsquo;s a decent lumbar support (without a true lumbar support piece found in some chairs) and prevents me from reclining all the way back. The mesh back keeps provides good support and allows for good air circulation. The seat is cushioned well too.Overall, considering its very reasonable price point and a 5 year warranty, this may be a good option for you. Be aware of its limited reclining angle.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="very-comfortable-and-well-made">Very comfortable and well made</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received this today and love it. It went together very easily, and not only were all the screws and washers present, but the manufacturer even included some spare hardware. The seat is well padded and overall the chair is extremely comfortable&hellip;the weather is hot and humid at the moment, so I also really appreciate the mesh back. I can adjust the height of the arms and back, and of course the seat height and lock or unlock the overall tilt. I find that the lumbar support is just right, as long as I&rsquo;m sitting up straight, and it is adjustable for different body types. The rollers are extremely smooth. The knob under the seat adjusts the tension of the tilt mechanism. It was quite tight from the factory, and it took some effort to loosen it&hellip;I like it to be a bit easier to lean back. The seat quality of the seat material and mesh back seems to be high enough to last for many years.I would say that, at this price, you&rsquo;d be hard-pressed to find a better chair, and over the years I have managed to find a few much worse at higher prices.READ MORE</p>
