<h5 id="i-have-finally-found-what-works-for-me">I Have Finally Found What Works For Me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WHY I LOOKED FOR THIS TYPE OF DEVICE: I live in an outlying, rural area with only incredibly slow DSL or satelite as options for internet. I have a Sprint MiFi Hotspot device (Franklin Wireless r850) with unlimited internet, but the signal to my house is spotty at best. An average measured RSSI of -82 dB is what I was getting with the hotspot placed in the best location within my house. This allowed for speeds of (again, measured average) 2.5 Mbps down and 1.6 Mbps up (compared to my old AT&amp;T DSL of 1.3 Mbps down and 0.2 Mbps up). Unfortunately, the signal was so bad that it would often drop out. So I knew I needed a cell signal booster.WHAT I TRIED: I purchased another indoor signal booster from a competitor to SureCall, but it didn&rsquo;t do much. I contacted that competitor (great customer service) and was told that their equipment does not work well with some of Sprint&rsquo;s ranges. They actually recommended looking at SureCall&rsquo;s devices.MY RESULTS WITH SURECALL: I purchased EZ 4G booster kit and, upon arrival, installed the receiver at the same spot where my hotspot received the best signal. I placed the repeater downstairs (about 30&rsquo; away) and my RSSI went from -82 dB to -52 dB!!! I thought that this was a fluke, so I ran continual tests over the past few days on the signal and the speeds. The signal ranged from -55 dB to -51 dB the entire time and I ran speed tests via testmy.net every 5 minutes for 4 days. My current average speeds over this time period are 5.1 Mbps down and 2.2 Mbps up. This is a significant improvement for me!Obviously, everyone will get different results, but I am super satisfied with this purchase.</p>

<h5 id="great-for-office-building">Great for office building</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My office building has cell service in the front but not toward the rear where my office is located. After getting a $2500 quote to install a booster from a professional, I decided to try this product. Luckily there was storage area that allowed me to easily run a 100ft coax cable without going through walls and cielings. I now have great cell service in my office. It amplifies an existing signal and also allows service where you place the antenna. You just have to be able to get the antenna to the location you want the service.</p>

<h5 id="which-has-been-great-the-only-problem-is-the-very-limited-range">which has been great. The only problem is the very limited range &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It turns our 1 bar of reception into 4 or 5, which has been great. The only problem is the very limited range of the antenna that rebroadcasts the signal, you have to be within a few feet of it to get the 4 or 5 bars. It allows us to communicate with the outside world, so we&rsquo;re keeping it. We have a two story house, so the dish is in the window on the second floor and I dropped the cable for the antenna down to the first floor.</p>

<h5 id="but-some-other-phones-are-not-so-fortunate-i-got-tired-of-my-agents-complaining-about">but some other phones are not so fortunate. I got tired of my agents complaining about &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have a small insurance office, My office is located on the lower level of the building. I have always had 2-3 bars on my t-mobile coverage; but some other phones are not so fortunate. I got tired of my agents complaining about dropped calls. I set up the unit. Then plugged it in. All of the phones now have better coverage. I did have to move the antenna a few times to get the best signal for all; but that was minor. I hope it lasts a long time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-product">Fantastic product.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I can finally get a cell signal. I live in a Condo and with all the cell phones on I get a very poor signal. Now I can get all bars full 89% of the time in 4glite. I also can my power cord in half a few weeks after getting it and I called and the gentleman sent me another one for free. I was very thankful I hope the company keeps making good products like this. I only have a 950 foot Condo and it says to put the dish and the antenna at least 2000 ft apart but I can&rsquo;t however it works great. I give it 5 stars all the way.fan·tas·tic</p>

<h5 id="wasn-t-perfect-but-from-zero-reception-to-what-i-got-was">Wasn&rsquo;t perfect but from zero reception to what I got was &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I brought this device to Hyannis, to a place where I had zero reception on my Cricket and AT&amp;T cell phones. Set up was a breeze. I was able to get two, sometimes three bars on both phones and was able to send and receive texts, calls and even some LTE and 4G. Wasn&rsquo;t perfect but from zero reception to what I got was a dramatic difference.</p>

<h5 id="verizon-cell-service-made-easy">Verizon cell service made easy</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After reading the reviews, I chose this Sure Cell for our river house. There was no service for Verizon users, but this magical booster now enables us to make and receive phone calls and text messages. Extremely easy to install. Literally&hellip; plug and play!! This is one happy customer!! ✳️✳️✳️✳️✳️ I&rsquo;m sure this would boost other carriers who already receive service! 😎</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So far, it is bringing our signals up a little more. We are using it in a very remote, wooded area. It has made a difference.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have tried two different Surecall products. One industrial and the EZ 4g. Neither worked even a little bit. Cell phone signal remains the same. Cell phone is usable by itself.</p>

<h5 id="doesn-t-setup">doesn&rsquo;t setup</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a small hotel in Nashville, TN and needed to find a way to boost service for our guests in the lobby/bar area. Very easy to install and provided service for the 1,000 sq.</p>

<p>It helps, but does not give a great deal of boost to the signal.</p>

<p>Meh, just got it set up. Still have to play around with locations. But so far I&rsquo;m underwhelmed with the performance.</p>
