<h5 id="solid-vr-at-an-affordable-price">Solid VR at an affordable price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, the shipping&rsquo;s quick: got my headset in two days coast to coast. Usually a good indicator the company means business. Packaged nicely with easy to understand and basic instructions.Build quality is good, and the unit is snugly put together. The headband is stretchy and thick, also done nicely from solid materials. The buttons on the unit for navigation and hardware control are clean and snappy, with intuitive layout. It feels a bit odd at first, but a little tinkering makes you comfortable quick.The headset wears fairly comfortable, considering it&rsquo;s a head-mounted computer. That being said, after about two hours I felt like I needed just a touch more padding. Other than that, the unit is so well done, with pupillary adjustment and scalable focus, (absolutely necessary after taking it to the bar and letting nearly a dozen friends flip out on it) that I have no complaints on the quality of the object itself. The lenses are easily removable to clean with the included cloth, and the molding surrounding all the interfaces on the bottom front ledge of the unit are cleanly molded with easy access. Headphones plug in snugly and the sound is wonderful. Haven&rsquo;t filled the local SD yet, so I can&rsquo;t tell you about the expandable storage. If it&rsquo;s as easy to handle as the wifi and Bluetooth settings, than it&rsquo;s completely painless.The unit comes loaded with some great VR experiences and a few good games. There&rsquo;s currently a plethora of companies hosting VR content on the pre-loaded Google Play Store, so a quick link up to wifi allows you access to damn near anything you can think of VR. It&rsquo;s friggin&rsquo; awesome. The graphical prowess of the unit is nothing to scoff at either. The 2560x1440 5.5 inch screen is gorgeous, refreshing at a headache-free 75Hz. This unit&rsquo;s so good, it&rsquo;s waiting for content to catch up with it. After experiencing phone-based VR, then trying these, I can comfortably say the difference is like night and day. Worth the price in my opinion. 4K support, HDMI in, Wifi, Bluetooth, AND Android 5.1 WITH the company saying firmware updates?! Hell, why not? It beats any phone-based VR I&rsquo;ve seen, and the battery life isn&rsquo;t bad either. I got nearly 4 hours straight on a %93 charge. And everybody I let demo it now wants one. I&rsquo;ll update this review after I try the SD, USB, and HDMI ports.</p>

<h5 id="works-well-but-quality-controll-is-out">Works well but quality controll is out.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to give this a good review but I can not. I got my headset a couple days ago. Upon unboxing I noticed on the right side of the screen there is a black speck, on the left side the inside of the lens also has a black speck. since it is internal I can&rsquo;t clean it off, otherwise the headset seems fine, but I am just going to return it. For about $300 I expect flawless internal view.</p>

<h5 id="bad-experience-not-4k-sd-slot-defect-bad-software">Bad Experience / Not! 4k / SD Slot Defect / Bad Software</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros: It turned on. HDMI input worked well.Its neat but defective.CONS:Cannot change you tube video quality in 360 view or app, Old you tube version not supporting 360 videos!.I CANT BREATH! This thing covers my nose and i sound like a duck. its to tight on the nose.Battery drains faster a can of soda u drink.Defective Micro SD Port: Better make sure you insert it with extreme caution as mine is now inside the device unrecoverable i want my SD Back!!Defective lenses: Blurrier then mashed potatoes on your screen. I felt the need to keep it clean 90% of the time.SCREEN PARTICLES: What the actual Crap this screen was loaded with micro particles all over i had to keep wiping the screen to get rid of stuff all over the inside of the screen.USB supplied cable is not new and is USED with some signs of rust and use.MISLEADING ADVERTISEMENT (((NOT 4K))) by a long shot! BS BS BS If this screen is 4k i am brad pit. More like 720P Marketing Lies! RCA has better video quality then this headset. My 20 dollar VR headset that i put a phone in had a better image quality. With 4k Each eye should recieve 1440P and it looks like a super Nintendo screen.User intuitive is in the trash. Extremely hard to use and Forget about using emulators because news flash it doesn&rsquo;t even find the Roms folder.Build quality is OK but poor. Feels like a toy in your hands. 3D performance is trash.WiFi connectivity on videos is so bad it buffers more then a floor scrubber.its 2017 why is this running android 5.0?????This thing is a joke and i challenge anyone to prove me wrong.I WANT MY MICRO SD CARD BACK THAT GOT STUCK INSIDE THE DEVICE.</p>

<h5 id="good-starter-vr-headset">Good starter VR headset</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this s few weeks ago and am enjoying it. It&rsquo;s only the second VR set I&rsquo;ve owned, so I can&rsquo;t compare it to others, but for the price it seems to be a good starter unit before spending several hundred more for a higher-quality device.PROs:Runs on Android, and among the included apps is a built-in browser and a link to the Google Play store.Has a built-in battery, so you can use it wirelessly.Supports Wi-Fi and BluetoothHas speakers built-in on the right and left ends, offering good stereo separation (although you can still use headphones, either Bluetooth, or wired.CONS:It&rsquo;s heavy on the front, so it crunches down on your nose. No matter how you adjust the straps, it will do this.Because the face piece blocks out all light, there is no ventilation and it gets hot after a little while.To see videos properly you have to download them first. It WILL play them online, but it can&rsquo;t process them quickly enough for smooth playback.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-video-quality-was-not-great-but-not-horrible">the video quality was not great but not horrible</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works but it&rsquo;s hardly comparable to some of the newer and more expensive sets. It was too slow, the video quality was not great but not horrible. The audio wasn&rsquo;t very good but if you have a set of bluetooth headphones and lack of large TV screen, you could potentially enjoy this set. Definitely get what you pay for and maybe a little more, but if you&rsquo;re someone like me, this isn&rsquo;t true VR. Still waiting to find something that isn&rsquo;t as expensive as a large 4K TV that won&rsquo;t be obsolete in a year or two. This purchase cemented my need to let this technology mature a little more.</p>

<h5 id="power-broke-after-first-plugging">Power broke after first plugging.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m giving this a 3 star rating due to the padding and nose area. Everything else is great, it&rsquo;s just there is not enough padding to even reach my cheeks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So far so good with this device, my kids love it. I had this only for a week. Will update the review after 2 or 3 months.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-reason-i-could-not-give-it-five-stars-is">THE REASON I COULD NOT GIVE IT FIVE STARS IS &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>THE REASON I COULD NOT GIVE IT FIVE STARS IS BECAUSE OF THE HEADBAND. THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH WEIGHT ON THE NOSE WHICH LIMITS HOW LONG YOU CAN WEAR IT!!!</p>

<h5 id="here-s-what-i-think-of-vr-4k-headset">Here&rsquo;s what I think of VR 4k headset</h5>

<p>I bought this headset because I wanted to play my Xbox one at night and not bother my room mate. I also liked the idea being able to lay down in bed while playing video games or&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="good-specifications-but-uncomfortable-and-low-build-quality">Good specifications, but uncomfortable and low build quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Screen resolution (1440p) and VR content looked good, but my buttons and LCD were damaged/discolored. Also headset padding was not enough. Had to return product.</p>

<h5 id="image-quality-good-design-no-so-good">Image quality good. Design no so good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Product is solid.Image quality good.Design no so good. At least not for my face.The unit squished my nose. There really is not a lot of room.</p>
