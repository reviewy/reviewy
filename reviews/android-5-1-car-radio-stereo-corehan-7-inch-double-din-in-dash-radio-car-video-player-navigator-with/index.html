<h5 id="surprise">Surprise!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to show what it looks like to unbox it.</p>

<h5 id="excellent-head-unit">excellent head unit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I really like this radio. It has a ton of great features and only a few drawbacks. The system itself runs quickly, boot up time is about ten seconds. I&rsquo;ve noticed no lagging running apps. The screen resolution is excellent. The touch screen works very well too. It has the google play store pre-installed so you can install Google Maps, Gmail, Pandora etc. So far I&rsquo;ve only found one app that wouldn&rsquo;t install which was PowerAmp.Another great feature that I didn&rsquo;t see in the description is you don&rsquo;t need an adapter for the steering wheel controls. It is pre-wired for steering controls and has a nice app built in that lets you set it up.So the downsides&hellip; It is slightly larger than a standard double din radio by about <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>&rdquo; of an inch in width and height. It&rsquo;s just enough to be a hassle. It took almost 3 hours for me to cut and sand the opening on my dash kit to make this fit and look good. The radio app starts up immediately by default which is annoying. It will start playing at what ever volume the system was shut off at and it can&rsquo;t be turned down until the system completely boots. Took me a while to figure out how to disable this. All you have to do is hit the back button on the left hand side of the head unit and it will shut off the radio until you start the app again.I also wanted to let people know what the passwords were to get into the Android Developer options and the &ldquo;Extra Settings&rdquo; menus.Developer options- 7890Extra Settings- 123456<strong><em>update</em></strong> I&rsquo;ve had the unit for a few months now and no major issues. The few problems I ran into(lack of written instructions leaves you lost sometimes) the customer service has been excellent. You can tell you are probably getting some one from China but they reply very quickly and clearly.</p>

<h5 id="love-it">Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it!! I was apprehensive on buying another android car stereo, because I bought a different brand before I bought this Corehan 7&rdquo; radio and it didn&rsquo;t work. I installed it in my wifes 2004 Infiniti I35, and it&rsquo;s really cool to have the capabilities of all the Android apps in the car! Very nice display, just wish the screen resolution was more brighter.</p>

<p>everything works. just wished the screen was sharper in image. sometimes when I use Bluetooth with the stereo, the stereo would reboot for no reason.</p>

<p>The first radio I got had a screen I think is upside down with the viewing angle being downward instead of up towards the driver and was so bright on GPS was unreadable(viewable).</p>
