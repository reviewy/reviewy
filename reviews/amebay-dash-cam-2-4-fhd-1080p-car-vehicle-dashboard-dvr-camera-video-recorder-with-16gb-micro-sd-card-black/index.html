<h5 id="many-good-features-including-automatic-date-time-and-gps-display">Many good features including automatic date/time and GPS display</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Have installed this item and find that it lives up to all the expectations that I had for it. It fully deserves the &ldquo; Which Magazine&rdquo; recommendation with its crystal clear display enabling number plates to be read. A continuous loop recording with three minute slots, and it switches on and off automatically when the engine is started or stopped. Many good features including automatic date/time and GPS display. It is not cheap, but well worth the investment. Very pleased.</p>

<h5 id="wow-this-product-exceeded-expectations">WOW This product exceeded expectations</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The first thing I noticed was the quality of the shipping box and foam packaging to cradlethe components. It also boasts a high quality, single language, glossy manual with images and print that does not require magnification. Spare fuses, 16GB class 10 card and card reader enhance the value. Unlike a similarly priced, 1-star product ordered in November, this device has initially exceeded expectations. The controls are positioned logically, i.e., no opposing buttons which invite problems. The set-up and menu options look familiar and, unlike the previous camera which was refunded, it is pleasing to havea comprehensive manual for assistance rather devoting the time to explore and fiddle around with the unit. The manual even provides a contact email if problems arise !! Although it may take a few weeks to uncover any designglitches the initial vibes are extremely positive.Potential buyers would benefit from reading all the questions posed and responses. This unit sold under a few different models by the same seller, which is not unusual. You will notice the seller is anxious to respond with information that may not be in the manual. The seller suggests using 12v car power supply for initial battery charge, not a USB port, a topic addressed in the manual FAQ and special orange card. Research indicates the USB port lacks the OOMPH of 12v power supply. Those questions/answers also address issues you may encounter regarding loop recording being negated by the lock function. Parking lot record and motion detection settings may also interfere with loop recording. I can deal with these potential conflicts since loop recording is a priority.The camera mount is tight so I intend to remove the camera from the windshield for any adjustments by disengaging the suction mount. I left an extra foot of power cord (wrapped around rear mirror mount) to keep the power supplied when it is removed from the glass. Although tempted to use the existing power supply (already routed) it is rated at 800mah vs 1amp for this camera (same voltage) so I will be installing the new power supply. Assuming everything from this point forward goes smoothly I would not hesitate to pick another camera for rear coverage and a few for gifts. The value is exceptional.TWO WEEK UPDATEFlawless operation and reliability. 720 video resolution is excellent. This unit might be categorized as &ldquo;entry level&rdquo;, but until I have the opportunity to evaluate one of the hundred buck models, boasting GPS and other features that impress me as overkill , I do not anticipate being overwhelmed by the desire to acquire a more costly product.</p>

<p> The only downside I believe, would be to provide a micro-sd card. After all what&rsquo;s the point buying a product at this price to then look for a fair price micro-sd card..to find out the sd-card is a fake or flashed. I know there are genuine suppliers on amazon (but it&rsquo;s fair to say know one can guarantee everyone or everything) after all the camera is only as good as the micro-sd card fitted..One point to remember when buying this product &ldquo;Buy a Good Genuine Micro-SD Card before you leave checkout&rdquo;</p>

<h5 id="having-had-a-good-look-at-many-reviews-for-various-car-cameras-i">Having had a good look at many reviews for various car cameras I &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Having had a good look at many reviews for various car cameras I determined that one or two of the &lsquo;better&rsquo; features, like GPS and the ability to send clips via wifi were not important for what I wanted. Driving through France a fair bit I decided all that was important was image quality and ease of use. The ability to detach this camera from the mount without unplugging I thought was a nice touch and, as the reviews had all been petty good</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Update: I emailed customer service in regards to the issue below. They responded very quickly explaining that all I needed to do was to pull really hard on the tab. I did just that and the clear film came off without me hurting the screen which I initially almost did because I didn&rsquo;t know why that tab was there.I also explained to them that the cables did not work for me. They were great in taking care of that issue as well! The minute I receive the cables I can finally use my dash cam. All I can say I&rsquo;m glad I bought this product from this company as they were great in responding quickly and gave great customer service!***************************************I haven&rsquo;t used it yet just played around with the features. It seems easy friendly compare to an expensive one I had bought for a family member. My issue with this is, I received it with a piece of tape on the corner! I thought you peel it off but as I tried to simply peel it off it wouldn&rsquo;t come off! Not only it didnt come off but it created air bubbles in the inside screen. I was able to smooth out out. But scared me I thought it broke before I was able to use it. That&rsquo;s when it felt cheaply made. I will be contacting customer service about this. Maybe this was just a bad batch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great for the price. I bought a second and have been using them for a month. I cannot read license plates unless they are close, but otherwise the picture is good.I think this is a great starter Dash Cam for anyone who wants one, but does not want to spend a lot of money or need a lot to extra features.</p>

<h5 id="hiding-the-lead-in-my-was-quite-easy-as-it-tucked-behind-the-trim-round-the-windscreen">Hiding the lead in my was quite easy as it tucked behind the trim round the windscreen</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Camera in the camera lasts for about 10 minutes so you need the power lead to be connected to the power socket in the car when using. Hiding the lead in my was quite easy as it tucked behind the trim round the windscreen, the only problem I had was down the side of the door and under the glovebox, but found a plastic guard that I could remove and hide the excess cable behind. I have also noticed on the web, a company that sells adaptor cables that have a blade fuse type end so you could plug it into the fuse box, but haven&rsquo;t researched that area yet.The Driving Recorder Player screen is comprehensive, showing a map of the journey, a compass, maximum speed and average speed but not the speed limit of the road, that can change depending on the whims of the local highways dept.</p>
