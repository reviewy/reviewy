<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="clean-it-up-back-there">Clean it up back there!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you like HDMI wires showing from behind your flat screen TV like garter snakes, then DO NOT BUY THESE. These 1.5 foot HDMI Cables from Twisted Vein will clean up your TV installation nicely. And it sounds like you don&rsquo;t want a clean installation. But seriously, Twisted Veins HDMI Cables are all I buy. I like the aesthetic (if I DO have to look at them, which I do not as my TV installations are clean) and I like the quality and price. But then again that&rsquo;s me. You may be into garter snakes and a lousy flat screen installation is desirable. Seriously, clean it up with some proper 1.5 foot HDMI cables. You really do not need the universal length of 6 feet HDMI for behind the TV. Must look like a snake pit back there.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-cords-for-the-price">Awesome cords for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve purchased multiple packs of these things ranging from this set of 1.5 feet up to a 50 foot cord to use with a projector outside. You can&rsquo;t beat the quality and price, and they even throw in the right angle adapter, a flashlight, and those amazing velcro ties. I&rsquo;ve never had a bit of trouble with this brand, and will continue to purchase them whenever I need another cable.The cord itself is braided, so it won&rsquo;t tangle and is likely to outlast me. They are very sturdy and out of the 20 or so cords I&rsquo;ve ordered, I&rsquo;ve yet to receive one that didn&rsquo;t work as advertised. Love these things! Don&rsquo;t waste your money on overpriced cords from big box stores - just pick up some of these.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="quality-stuff">Quality stuff</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Inexpensive and well packaged. I bought 2 packs (totaling 6 cables) but only used 3 because 1.5 ft wasn&rsquo;t long enough to reach other components. I used 2 on my Xbox 360 and Xbox One and they worked fine. I would definitely consider this brand again in the future.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect">Perfect</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any way to run a full test on an HDMI cable, so I don&rsquo;t know how these would test, but they work perfectly and appear very solid - nice grips on the connections, good feel to the fabric cable covering, and they LOOK so great - very impressive. It&rsquo;s a real cute gimmick that they include both velco-style cable wraps and a right angle HDMI adapter, which can be very handy. And a nice touch to have a little micro-fiber cloth and a cute little LED light included; no relation to the cable, but a wonderful little treat. BTW, excellent packaging for the ensemble - it just LOOKS professional. Perfect. Absolutely perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="best-deal-for-short-hdmi-cables">Best deal for short HDMI cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Packaged well and works perfectly. It also comes with a keychain light. Best deal for short HDMI cables. I use mines to connect my field monitor to my camera. The lining of the cables is rugged and it appears to not have any durability weaknesses.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-perfect-size">The perfect size</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these because our cable company now requires either regular or mini-boxes. A 3 or 6 foot cable in the places we had to put three mini-boxes would have been too long. It seems everything requires an HDMI cable now. These cables were long enough - at a foot and a half - to connect the mini box to the cable and TV but not so long that we had to fold them all up with cable ties. I didn&rsquo;t need to use the little corner adapter, but saved it for the future just in case. Totally pleased with my purchase.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wow">Wow!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking, how could 3 hdmi cables that cost less than $3 each elicit an explanatory review, you are correct. Normally, they shouldn&rsquo;t but these aren&rsquo;t normal hdmi cables. For that price I received 3 Velcro ties, screen cleaning cloth, adhesive labels, micro flashlight, 270° adapter, and 3 very durable hdmi cords that are guaranteed for life. Probably the best $8 investment I&rsquo;ve ever made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-cables">great cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great cables. I am using one as a computer monitor cable and the other as a U-Verse set-top box cable to the TV. No negative issues after a couple weeks of use. They are much more pliable that standard HDMI cables. The added goodies (angle adapter, &ldquo;velcro&rdquo; strips, and cleaning cloth) are a nice added touch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="twisted-veins-work">Twisted Veins work</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The 1.5 were a little short for what I needed but they work great in the kids room for hooking up the many video games and DVD player.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="spoilers-comes-with-a-free-poster">Spoilers: Comes with a free poster</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love these cables. hate the flashlight ,but love the cables. Ive lost count of how many of these ive bought.</p>

<p>High end product!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-cables-they-are-little-bit-rigged-and-not">Very nice cables, they are little bit rigged and not &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice cables, they are little bit rigged and not as flexible as PVC coated cables. They worked well for my application</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good">Good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Quick shipping. Good product</p>
