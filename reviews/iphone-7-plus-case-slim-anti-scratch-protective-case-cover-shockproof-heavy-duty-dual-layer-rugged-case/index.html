<h5 id="overall-a-very-good-case">Overall a very good case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice case, the charging port is readily available, I don&rsquo;t have to pull down the case to access it. I had no difficulty attaching larger older lightning cables due to the sufficiently large opening. I could hear the speakers clearly, and my contacts had no problems hearing my voice during calls. The buttons are responsive, no complaints there. The ridges on the side is a plus especially when you have sweaty hands in the summer. I&rsquo;ve used other cases before, but this one feels secure and does not feel like it will slip out of my hand. The case is rubberized, but does not feel icky, nice and smooth, but not slippery. The extra hard plastic back on top of the flexible case is a major selling point because it gives a stiff, sturdy feeling to the whole case. The lack of pointy edges make it easier to pull from my pocket without getting stuck. The case has enough thickness to absorb most shocks from my experience, although the iphone is quite sturdy, this is definitely a plus especially on cement floors that can scratch the case. And my iphone now finally have some clearance between the lens and the table preventing unnecessary contact with the desk. Also, I find that my finger are less likely to touch the lens due to the fact that I can now feel border around where the lens are located. And I could see the Apple logo nice cut out, yay!Pros:Adequate openings for charging and speaker and microphoneResponsive buttonsNo pointy edgesFlexible case with stiff backingDoes not obscure Apple logoCamera lens less exposedThick enough for shock absorptionCons:??? what more can you ask for from a case?</p>

<h5 id="perfect-protection-no-bulk">Perfect Protection - No Bulk !</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is exactly what I wanted. Protection without the bulk. Some folks have experienced problems installing the screen protector. Instruction that were included were thorough and I didn&rsquo;t have any issues. One major plus was I received an email from Yesgo with a You Tube video on protector installation the exact same day that I received the phone. Great pro active customer service.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-nice">So Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it for my jet black 7 plus and it fits perfect I feel like I can trust for this case and screen protector I would definetly offer you to buy this case</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="satisfied-but">Satisfied but</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far I&rsquo;m very satisfied, screen protector was easy to put on, it doesn&rsquo;t cover the screen width wise 100% but it covers enough. The case itself feels sturdy. I haven&rsquo;t dropped it yet, but I&rsquo;ll be sure to update when I do.Update: it&rsquo;s been 2 months and I&rsquo;m still satisfied with this case. It&rsquo;s thin enough I can hold it and thick enough to protect my phone. However the screen protector does have some cracks in it and even cut my ear open somehow without me noticing. Only happened once but very odd.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-nice-quality-and-im-picky-squares-out-the-phone">Very nice quality. (And im picky) squares out the phone &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice quality. (And im picky) squares out the phone nicely so its not too rounded (i liked the 4 and 5 iphones the were squared. Not a fan of the rounded like older iphone so this beefs it a little but still slim and not bulky) very nice. I would buy the same one if this one gets scratched up and I&rsquo;ve had it a couple months and not aick of it at all. Easy 5 stars for me</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-case-is-amazing-i-love-it-have-a-really-good-price">This case is amazing, I love it have a really good price &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case is amazing, I love it have a really good price I asked in T-mobile and the told me that they have this case for $32.50 and I found it for a really good price hace a good quality and a really nice presentation (the box is really nice) I recommend it :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-case-for-the-price">Great case for the price.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had the case for a week now and I am very pleased. The case appears ruged enough to take whatever abuse that I could dish out but thin enough that it doesn&rsquo;t become a burden when handling the phone or carrying it in my back pocket.The screen cover is great and it does have a cutout for the front camera.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="amazing-so-far">Amazing so far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Case feels sturdy in my hands. I was hesitant about the design, but it looks good. The screen protector is an added bonus, if anything I wish it was a little bigger.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="looks-sleak-and-does-it-s-job-well">Looks sleak and does it&rsquo;s job well!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the the case!! I would definitely recommend this product to a bunch of friends, I have already drowned my phone a bunch it times at the club and every time the case did&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-it-did-a-very-good-job-of-protecting-my-phone">but it did a very good job of protecting my phone</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This case lasted a year, but it did a very good job of protecting my phone. Eventually it broke on the bottom around the charger port</p>
