<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="powerful-lil-guy">Powerful lil guy🌪</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this fan so much!!! Bought for my sons room and let me tell you&hellip; It is powerful!! My son has a hard time staying asleep because of the creeks and cracks he hears in the middle of the night. So after reading reviews, I found a fan that made noise. The white noise is very effective at helping one sleep through the night. Not only is my teen sleeping better but it also cools off the room perfectly. And it&rsquo;s a big bedroom. Very happy</p>

<h5 id="very-powerful-little-fans-that-oscillate-smoothly-two-months-of-nonstop-use-and-still-running-strong">Very powerful little fans that oscillate smoothly - two months of nonstop use and still running strong!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> These fans are awesome! I bought two of these to cool my grow tents with. They have two fan speed options. Both speeds are actually quite powerful and move the air very well. They oscillate very smoothly. I ran both of them for 2 months straight with almost no downtime and they are still working like champs. I&rsquo;m very impressed with the quality of these. Great value.</p>

<h5 id="blizzard-lives-up-to-it-s-name">Blizzard, lives up to it&rsquo;s name!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I grew up in the deserts, yes plural. My parents thought it would be fun to move from desert-like state, to desert-like state and see which would be the hottest! Okay, probably not, but they liked the desert more than anyone should and did not appreciate the bill you&rsquo;d get for running the A/C, much to my despair. So when I tell you I know about fans&hellip; I know about fans. No really, I do.I hate being hot. I cannot stand it to the degree, ha no pun intended!, that when I get too uncomfortably hot I get migraines. That being said I have gone though more fans in my life than I&rsquo;d care to admit, and I know when I come across a really good and well made fan.After living in the desert, I up and moved on my own to a lush-green state and found something out&hellip; humidity is so much hotter than arid dry heat! BLAH! For about 6 months after moving I could not find a fan that would keep me from melting (reaching critical mass!) and then, my fellow overheated humans, I found the BLIZZARD! The air actually feels cool as it blows out and not like an oven to the face as so many fans do. The current is strong, it&rsquo;s sturdy, it can oscillate(and stay in place), and you can adjust the angle (up/down), and even lock it in place with a turn-y lever thing.I liked this little beast so much I have 3 of them in my house. One in the bedroom, one in the kitchen, and one in my pc room. I didnt want to keep moving my fan from place to place so I just bought a few extra to keep my entire house cool, and it does. I don&rsquo;t have A/C in my place and I don&rsquo;t need it, not with these mechanical blizzards! :)</p>

<h5 id="the-best-oscillating-fan-you-can-get">The best oscillating fan you can get</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have purchased this product numerous times for friends and family. It served as my best friend when living in a dorm with no air conditioner, it served me well in my office during hot days, and it serves my family&rsquo;s living room as well! It has two speeds (high and low) and an oscillating feature. You can also adjust the fan up and down so that it can be positioned in a way to fit your needs. I have never had one give out on me and have had one for at least 5 years of continuous use&hellip; love this product!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="an-intense-blow-from-a-small-desk-top-fan">An intense blow from a small desk-top fan.&rsquo;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had a Vornado before I bought this one. Even on high, it was not much of a breeze. I was happy when it died. This fan is just the opposite. On low it produces a rather strong blow. The high setting will blow your hair back, and both settings blow papers off the desk. It is almost too strong a breeze. There are only two speeds, the reason I didn&rsquo;t give it 5 stars. There should be three, one a bit lower than this unit&rsquo;s lowest setting. The oscillating switch is very difficult to work. Still, if you want a small fan that produces a very strong blow, this one is for you. I read all the 1 star reviews and I did not have the problems that the reviewers stated. I don&rsquo;t think it is too loud at all. I haven&rsquo;t used it for long yet, so time will tell if they were correct in their assessment that it failed early on. I kept the shipping boxes, just in case.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-too-crazy-about-the-oscillating-function">Not Too Crazy About the Oscillating Function</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re not going to find a 5 star fan for less than $20.If you&rsquo;re looking for a fan that blows straight ahead and does it well, this is your fan. Seems to be well balanced and moves air nicely. It should last a long time. If you&rsquo;re looking for a fan you plan on using the Oscillating feature regularly, keep looking, this is not it. The oscillating movement is jerky like it&rsquo;s hanging up on something inside the housing, in both directions. That means it&rsquo;s either a bad design, or poor assembly. Either way, it probably won&rsquo;t last too long. I&rsquo;m not interested in taking it apart to see what&rsquo;s wrong. My primary use is blow straight ahead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="effective-cute-small-quiet-enough">Effective, Cute, Small, Quiet-enough</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great little fan that isn&rsquo;t too loud. I have it on the sill of my large picture window in the living room and it helps to circulate air around my decent sized apartment. It&rsquo;s also immensely helpful when I have the AC on. This little fan pushes the cold air all around. Only complaint is that it is starting to fall apart and it absolutely shouldn&rsquo;t be!! It sits on the sill which is a sturdy foundation, has plenty of room to oscillate, and does not get moved around. I noticed a bottom piece fell off and also a piece covering a screw just slid off that holds the plastic border around the fan blades. I hope it holds up because it&rsquo;s a nice little fan and it&rsquo;s not being &ldquo;abused.&rdquo; Overall it&rsquo;s terrific and you can&rsquo;t go wrong with this fan (unless it continues to fall apart little by little&hellip; then that&rsquo;s a problem).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="didnt-work-out-of-the-box">Didnt work out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Only giving it two stars because the one I ordered didn&rsquo;t work right out of the box. The motor was literally seized and it just hummed&hellip;had I left it on it would probably have started burning and tripped the breaker. The oscillating button was clearly not functional either&hellip;I had to grab it with my fingers and pull it up.I returned it and did not ask for a replacement. I would be concerned about any product that was such a failure right out of the box. That tells me even a working one might be a problem in the future.There was no damage to the packaging, so other than being thrown around like any other UPS package there was no external reason it could have been damaged</p>
