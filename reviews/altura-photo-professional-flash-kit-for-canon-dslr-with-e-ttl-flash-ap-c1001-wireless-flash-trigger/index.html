<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-product-from-a-supplier-that-stands-behind-it">Great product from a supplier that stands behind it</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Like other reviewers, I was somewhat skeptical that this could compare with Canon speedlights. After using this flash for a week or so, it performs great, communicates.with the camera, and has plenty of range. As for the supplier, I had a problem with the wireless unit, after contacting the company, they immediately sent out a replacement unit, no questions asked. This is the type of service that all companies should provide, do not hesitate to do business with Digital Goja!</p>

<h5 id="taken-my-photography-to-a-new-level">Taken my photography to a new level.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this item for my Canon t3i. It works perfectly. I was truly surprised at how simple to use this set up really is. The flash is on par with any speed-light that I&rsquo;ve ever used. The only difference between this flash and ones costing well over $400, is the price. It works as well or better than Canon brands.Secondly, I have never used the wireless system before now. Wow&hellip; What a difference it makes. The ability to place your flash where it&rsquo;s needed most; priceless. The system is so straight forward and easy to use. I&rsquo;m by far not a beginner&hellip; just new to off shoe flash triggers. I simply hooked everything together and was taking better photos in less than five minutes.I will be adding a second flash and trigger soon as to be able to better adjust my background lighting as well.Please never hesitate to use Digital Goja. I have made five orders from them in the past six weeks alone and I can tell you they are bar none the best group of people I&rsquo;ve every enjoyed ordering from. 100% of my business that they cover will come from them due to service alone, price is just a plus.</p>

<h5 id="i-would-like-to-give-this-product-a-zero-star-rating">I would like to give this product a zero star rating</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Returned this for the second time. Their entire product set doesn&rsquo;t work. The triggers work when they want to and same thing with their flashes. I had it working at home, then went to a shoot, spent thousands on models and the flash didn&rsquo;t work on camera or off camera either by triggering off my flash or off the triggers. I would like to give this product a zero star rating. They wrote and promised to have a tech call me and weeks went by without the tech ever calling.</p>

<h5 id="best-flash-for-the-money-if-you-re-not-looking-for-professional-studio-equipment">Best flash for the money if you&rsquo;re not looking for professional studio equipment!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am certain I already wrote a review but I will do this again.. This gets a full 5 stars from me as it far exceeded my expectations for the price! Under a hundred dollars with 180 degrees of motion, TTL (Through The Lens) automatic syncing, strobe and wireless slave! This is a MUST HAVE for a hobbyist like myself!If you do not know what a slave flash is.. It&rsquo;s where you can put this thing on it&rsquo;s stand, use your pop up flash or another flash attached to your camera and get more lighting! Somewhat more of a professional feel to your photos and opens up a huge array of lighting tricks for your photography..With the TTL auto syncing it is much more difficult for me to overexpose photos by accident since it reads your lens/camera settings to prepare your flash.This is just amazing to me. I have worked in photography and I am a lover of photography as a hobby and for anyone who wants to take great photos with great lighting without the big expensive set up&hellip; This is completely worth it.Built firm and comes with it&rsquo;s own protective case.The only flaw for me would be in the design of the case where you would store batteries. Since your diffuser goes in the bottom of that, your batteries will not fit in those nifty holders.. Not a big deal.. I carry lots of extras in my camera&rsquo;s main bag..</p>

<h5 id="had-high-hopes-for-all-of-2-hours">Had high hopes for all of 2 hours</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My initial thoughts were this is a very nice flash. The plastic hot shoe plate on my other off-name flash broke, so I was happy when I saw this one was metal. Everything felt nice about this flash and it worked great the first time I put it on my camera and played with the remote triggers. I packed it away and about 2 hours later took it out again to show my husband only to find the flash won&rsquo;t fire at all! It doesn&rsquo;t matter what setting it&rsquo;s on, even pushing the pilot button to test will not get it to flash. I reset it multiple times as they show in their videos, and still no flash. I even went out and bought new batteries of a different big name brand and nothing. I planned to repurchase through Amazon and return this defective one only to find that now, 2 days after my purchase, the price is higher than I paid. I have an email in to them to them, so I guess I will get to see if the customer service really is as great as everyone has commented on. I will update my review accordingly.Update 1/10/17 - I received a prompt response from the seller and they were very fast in rectifying the situation. Their customer service truly is top notch. New flash is working well so far, so fingers are crossed that this one will continue working!</p>
