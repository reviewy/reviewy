<h5 id="perfect-for-my-portable-hard-drive">perfect for my portable hard drive</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This little pouch is perfectly sized for holding my portable hard drive and its usb cable. It&rsquo;s great for helping to protect the drive during travel, and to make certain the cord doesn&rsquo;t get separated from it and lost. My dad also has one of these bags, and he uses it as an accessories bag for his tablet. It holds the things that don&rsquo;t fit in his tablet sleeve such as his mouse, usb cable, memory cards, and spare portable battery charger.FEATURES:- great quality, well stitched- very pretty- image is clear and sharp (not blurry or pixelated)- image color is accurate to listing photos- same image on front and back- case is malleable, so it will adjust to work for many different items- perfectly fits a portable hard drive (with cable)- double zipper pulls- zipper opens and closes smoothly- zipper extends partially down the sides of the bag, so it is very easy to get things in and out of the case- detachable wrist strap- wrist strap has actual metal clasp, doesn&rsquo;t just loop throughOverall, I am very pleased with this bag. It&rsquo;s cute and perfect for what I wanted.</p>

<h5 id="smart-case-for-cross-body-bags">smart case for cross body bags</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered the Aupet black Digital Camera Case to hold a new Sony Cyber-shot camera that I&rsquo;m taking to Alaska. I am so very pleased with the fabric and the design of this case. The Sony company included a case with the camera but I donated it as I&rsquo;m a woman and don&rsquo;t strap things on my body. I wanted a small case that I could carry in my cross boy purse and this case was perfect. The black design(swirls) is very smart looking and I will be proud to show it to other people. There is enough room to carry other memory cards as well. The case has a hand strap and I have a an old strap that will fit if I want to wear it around my neck. The color is very nice and the company says the case is washable but it take a lot of wear before I will need to wash it. I&rsquo;m please I chose this case. Soft and will slide into your purse easily. The case has 2 pulls on the zipper which is very nice.</p>

<h5 id="love-this-case">Love this case!!!💜💜💜😘</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love my camera case.It IS smaller than pics lead you to believe. It will hold all the things they showed . Just not at once. Its the camera or your other stuff.My point and shoot fits perfectly and its padded too so the camera has extra protection.All in all extremely happy with my case. Its cute and it does the job!!!</p>

<h5 id="double-zipper-hides-zipper-seam-nifty-pretty-camera-bag-i-got-2">Double zipper hides zipper seam, nifty pretty camera bag, I got 2!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great soft camera bag with double zippers that close up so you can&rsquo;t see the zipper seam (that&rsquo;s really nice actually, a hidden zipper seam). It fits my Canon PowerShot SX610 HS digital camera well, though you might want to add extra padding for expensive cameras (I certainly will be doing that). Not much more room for anything else, except maybe 1-2 SD cards, it&rsquo;s a good snug fit (even without extra padding).Graphics are pretty close as what is shown in the photo for the ad, though not as bright in color (though minimal, still really good compared to other products like this). Very well recommended, I bought two (this pink butterfly one for me and a horse lightning one for my sister). Definitely a good buy, I&rsquo;m glad I got these camera bags!</p>

<h5 id="perfect-to-either-carry-alone-or-in-your-camera-bag">Perfect to either carry alone or in your camera bag &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect to either carry alone or in your camera bag so your camera doesn&rsquo;t scratch.. Size is perfect for my Nokia CoolPix, not too big so the camera isn&rsquo;t sliding around while you are moving, and not so small that you have to cram to fit it in. Love the design and fabric. The convenience of the strap! It is a life savor for those that are afraid of dropping or leaving your camera behind. I&rsquo;m very pleased with this purchase.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-disappointed-it-may-still-work-for-some-of-the">I&rsquo;m disappointed. It may still work for some of the &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This was smaller than I expected. I bought it to hold zoom lenses for my partner&rsquo;s smartphone. It&rsquo;s part of her birthday package. I was afraid it would be too small to hold all the zoom lenses, but they actually fit perfectly. Yay!!! It&rsquo;s a cute little case, perfect for the job.</p>

<h5 id="awesome-little-bag-great-for-multiple-purposes">Awesome Little Bag Great For Multiple Purposes</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I LOVE this little bag so much! I bought two -one as a makeup bag &amp; one for phone charger, battery, etc. Will probably buy at least one more for my camera backpack for cords, cards &amp; a couple of extra batteries. This bag is small - I suppose it would work for a very tiny camera, but I bought them with no intention of using them for that purpose. The handle makes this especially handy!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-little-camera-bag">Perfect little camera bag</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this little camera bag fto use as an extra battery holder, and it is perfect. To use for a small camera, it would be great. It is very nicely padded to protect your camera. Love the different patterns you can purchase also. You can&rsquo;t really go wrong with this item. Seller is great also!</p>
