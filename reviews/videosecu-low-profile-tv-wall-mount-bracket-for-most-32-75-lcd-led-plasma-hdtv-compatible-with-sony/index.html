<h5 id="after-tightening-plugged-the-tv-in-everything-worked-great-took-me-about-30-minutes-from-start-to">After tightening - plugged the TV in everything worked great. Took me about 30 minutes from start to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok - So I am pleasantly surprised.Ordered this item Sunday morning - arrived today (Tuesday) see my pictures to follow along.Box was very small - first thought - oh heck, but it turned out - the bracket is in 2 pieces and you&rsquo;ll need to bolt together (easy)The second set of brackets go to the back of TV.Hint for hanging, trick is to bolt brackets together first, what i do that makes my projects level every time - first find your wall studs - the i place an all, me I have some old very thin alan style screwdrivers - i place one in the wall at the stud - make very sure your level is setting square on your tool or nail - swing your 24&rdquo; level so it reads level - then stick your next nail or tool in place, again make sure your level is sitting square on the 2 nails or your tool. take the level off and give both a tap with a hammer to make sure your hitting the wall stud. next drill 2 pilot holes. and attach your wall mount to the wall - again verify square - if everything&rsquo;s level - i just drill 2 more pilot holes straight down into the wall in the proper holes in the bracket.I attached the second set of brackets to the TV, THIS IS IMPORTANT - not much room when the TV is on the wall - I connected the power and the HDMI cables before I hung the TV. I&rsquo;m sure this saved a head ache of taking the TV down because of lack of room.Once on the wall - YOU WILL NEED A PHILLIPS HEAD SCREWDRIVER THAT IS AT LEAST 10-12 INCHES LONG!!!!! very hard to screw in the screws that lock the TV in place without a long screwdriver. After tightening - plugged the TV in everything worked great. Took me about 30 minutes from start to finish - and yes - because I was only looking to hang a TV without options - this wall mount is inexpensive and works great!!</p>

<h5 id="wow-sturdy-for-the-price">Wow! Sturdy for the price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this mount for a 70 inch Vizio television. I think the TV model number is: E701i-A3I pulled out the pieces, and it appeared to come with a lot of screws and other items. I was nervous it was going to take a lot of putting together, but then I found out it basically comes with screws for tons of different televisions at their different mounting sizes. Sure enough, it had the exact right screws for my Vizio.I started working on getting my studs located, and found them quickly. Drilled small preholes to make sure I found them alright, and then drilled holes at the size recommended in the instructions. In order to get everything level, I used my own level because I had read many reviews that the little small one it came with was off. However, after I screwed the mount to the wall, I placed their level on top and it confirmed everything was level. It seemed to work just fine.It was easy to lift the TV and get it to hook to the mount. (Besides the fact that the TV was a HEAVY BEAST) As soon as the top hooks were over the mount, it hung on the wall beautifully! As mentioned, the TV is not light at all, and it has been up now for over a month!There is one con to mention:The mount is a super low profile mount. There are screws at the bottom you are supposed to tighten, but unless I had a 3 foot screw driver, I have no idea how to get my hand back there and do it. Hasn’t caused any problems, but it isn’t as sturdy as it could be. (This could be a huge pro for some people!)My rating is a 4.8 star rating, but rounded up because it has been an amazing mount overall!</p>

<h5 id="great-and-inexpensive-but-take-hdmi-out-on-tv-into-consideration-before-buying">Great and inexpensive but take HDMI out on TV into consideration before buying.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If you mount this well like do a good job and attach it to studs, your TV will not fall. But here it what you need to take into consideration, for a large and heavy TV make sure you connect all your wires before hand and make sure you have a TV that has all its HDMI and audio out facing down to the floor or this will not work.Once put up, your TV is going to be pretty flush with the wall. So if your out put connectors are facing the back wall you are NOT going to be able to use this guy, because the TV will be resting against the cables. I used it with a Vizio 75in tv which I believe is a little over 100LBS and been a month TV has not fallen off the wall. But let me tell its was no joke when I need to switch the HDMI around the back, you pretty much have toe take the TV off the wall.</p>

<h5 id="low-pro">Low pro.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works well &amp; easy to install. Like other posts have said, there&rsquo;s not a whole lot of room behind this once the TV is hung as it&rsquo;s &ldquo;low profile&rdquo;. But that&rsquo;s the look I was going for. I sometimes wish I got one that tilts due to me having some accent lights right above the tv that glare, but we just shut them off when we&rsquo;re watching tv. It worked out good with my 65&rdquo; 4K.(Sorry, not the best pics, I tried to get one from the side, but it&rsquo;s all I had on my phone.)</p>
