<h5 id="way-better-than-i-expected">Way better than I expected.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I actually had changed my mind about the purchase before it arrived, so I had every intention of returning it. For some reason I decided to try it and I was really impressed. First by the sound quality. I&rsquo;m at a stage in life where I don&rsquo;t like to settle for stuff (part of the reason I was going to return it and buy a more expensive product). These have a sound far superior to many wired headsets that cost significantly more.The fit is OK, I&rsquo;m still getting used to them. I primarily use them for weight lifting (heavy), cardio (machines and jumping rope) and while shooting around on the basketball court. I&rsquo;m never in fear that they&rsquo;re going to fall off, but I&rsquo;m still &ldquo;playing&rdquo; with the different cup sizes to get the best fit.I would highly recommend these to anyone who wants great sound, especially while being active.</p>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic">Fantastic!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a pair of Bluetooth headphones quite a while ago, and being an audiophile, I just couldn&rsquo;t stand the sound of them from all of the compression. Bluetooth has improved quite a lot since then, and with v4.1 it makes the sound just as good as any premium headphones! These are honestly better than my Sony MDRXB50AP earbuds&rsquo; sound quality!</p>

<p>I should have returned this headphones but got busy and my time ran out. Unless you leave them plugged they will NOT keep a charge for any length of time and the play time is very short.They are bulky, uncomfortable and I would NOT advise anyone to purchase these. Hard to wear with glasses also. Extremely unhappy with this purchase.</p>
