Keep your nüvi in place with this portable friction mount. It&rsquo;ll keep everything in plain sight when you need it and out of the way when you don&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Place the mount on any stable surface, and adjust the position of your GPS to your liking. The friction mount weighs enough to keep your device put on the dash, even when sudden maneuvers are necessary. It&rsquo;s ideal for states in which the use of windshield suction mounts is illegal.</p>

<p>In addition to its convenience, you can quickly place your GPS out of sight, and without leaving any residue on the windshield, both handy for any potential prying eyes.</p>

<h5 id="my-favorite-gps-mount-so-far">My Favorite GPS Mount So Far</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is great. I rely on the voice assist on my GPS to help me avoid looking down while driving, but sometimes it can&rsquo;t be avoided. I&rsquo;ve tried many different GPS mounts with different vehicles over the years and this is by far my favorite. It is very well weighted and stays on the top of my dashboard while driving. A quick glance and I can read the GPS.Another advantage of this is that once the mounting bar is in place, you can either lock it in place (so you would have to move the whole thing around to change the angle) or leave it unlocked and it will turn 360 degrees horizontally as needed. The mounting bar doesn&rsquo;t turn without assistance so I will probably never lock it.I have one of those dashboard compartments so if it is particularly sunny or I am on a bumpy road, I can place it in there to help shade it and keep it in place.</p>

<h5 id="best-solution-for-nuvi-in-my-prius-and-my-ford-theft-protection-as-well">Best Solution for NUVI in my Prius and my Ford: Theft Protection As Well!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Prius has a rough dashboard and a windshield that slopes very sharply. Thus, the suction cup mounts are not good solutions. Fortunately, the friction mount is a great solution. It works much better than I expected. Very stable, does not slide, and lets me adjust my Nuvi to a variety of different angles. I can place the GPS anywhere on the dash or even on the center console. Also works great when transferred to my wife&rsquo;s Ford.Only downside to the device is that it has a rather large footprint, but not prohibitively large. I like the fact that I can easily use this in both of our family vehicles depending on where we need the GPS.UPDATE: Now that I have used this mount regularly since May, I have to say this is the best mounting solution I&rsquo;ve found for a GPS or any other device for my car. It hasn&rsquo;t slid out of place once!! Given the rise in GPS units being stolen from cars, this mount allows you to easily stash your GPS Unit and mount out of sight and then put it back into position with ease.2009 Update: Still using this in my Prius and my wife has one too. It&rsquo;s held up quite well. It IS a bit bulky to store out of the way when not in use, but still a good solution. I usually remove my GPS from the mount (a simple process) and then place the mount as far under the seat as it will go. Not perfect, but the best solution I&rsquo;ve found to date.</p>

<h5 id="repurposing-as-a-magnetic-phone-mount-awesome-for-my-dashboard">Repurposing as a magnetic phone mount. Awesome for my dashboard.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m using this as the base for my magnet mount phone holder. I&rsquo;ve purchased a Nekteck magnetic mount with the rectangular head (<a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Nekteck-Magnetic-Cradle-less-Universal-Samsung/dp/B014QKBEHM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481745867&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=nekteck+car+mount">https://smile.amazon.com/Nekteck-Magnetic-Cradle-less-Universal-Samsung/dp/B014QKBEHM/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1481745867&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=nekteck+car+mount</a>), then pulled the head off and put it on this base. Voila! A magnetic car mount that doesn&rsquo;t block the air vent, doesn&rsquo;t require a heavy-duty adhesive on the dash, and won&rsquo;t tear up my CD slot. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s easy to throw under a seat or into the glove box if I need to hide it away. Perfect for how I use my phone for navigation and listening to Spotify over Bluetooth.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="wish-it-had-all-the-parts-to-mount-it-in-the-first-place">Wish it had all the parts to mount it in the first place!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My only note to make about this mount is that if your gps doesn&rsquo;t have a suction cup to attach to the back of the unit, you will need to get one, as this came with everything but that. When I got this I then had to go look for the suction cup that allows you to slide it into the ball, and then mount it on the back of my gps. Otherwise, this unit stays in place better than the other mount I had purchased previously.The suction cup I had to purchase looks like this one: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DQN3RG2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1So">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DQN3RG2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1So</a> while this works as it should, it gets 4 stars because it was missing the suction cup for the gps itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="counterfeit-product-likely-a-fake">Counterfeit Product. Likely a fake.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Counterfeit Product. Likely a fake. Ball is too small. Requires tissue be shoved in hole or Garmin GPS tilts forward. Lock function didn&rsquo;t work so put cardboard under the thumb lever. Spring is thin and way too short. That worked awhile. Threads on turn mechanism are cut too thin to catch firmly. It would be very surprising if Garmin made such a poorly functioning and defective product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-was-a-great-solution-however">This was a great solution, however</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this because the suction cup that comes with the GPS doesn&rsquo;t hold up over time and no longer sticks to my windshield. This was a great solution, however, the stem that is used to attach GPS to is on a very loose pivot. So in normal driving/turning, the GPS pivots around and can go out of sight. Yes, I can just swing it back into view, but it isn&rsquo;t convenient. This is better than the previous suction cup falling off the windshield while driving and startiling the bejesus out of me though. haha</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-sorta">Works, sorta&hellip;&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason this unit gets only an 3-star &ldquo;ok&rdquo; is because it does NOT remain in position on the dash. This in a 2015 Tahoe sheriff patrol unit. I use a windshield mount in the left corner on my 2013 but this unit has a radar ant mounted there now so I got the dash &ldquo;non-slip&rdquo; pad to mount the GPS unit on. Well, it sets there fine, but a little to much gas peddle and off it all goes onto the control counsel, or any turns and it slides in the opposite direction.Trying to figure out a fix and if not, then back it goes and look for another solution. Center window mounts are out as you can not reach it from the drivers seat. AC mounts on rough dirt roads often fall off and certainly jump around. Dash on the Tahoe is just to slick ! It works but on this vehicle model, it does not work without issues so, three stars and not recommended.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-this-method-of-holding-my-electronics">I love this method of holding my electronics.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like this style better than the suction cup bracket for the windshield. It sits perfectly on the dash, steering column, passenger seat, or on the console between the two front seats. It&rsquo;s heavy duty and doesn&rsquo;t slide around or fall over. The ball joint swivels and locks into place as you want it. I prefer this method of holding the GPS so I can easily hide the GPS when parking and not have to fumble around removing it from the windshield and reattaching when I come back. This method also helps keep the GPS out of direct sunlight because I can move it around to different spots in the car. I live in Arizona and the sun can ruin your electronics. being able to hide the device quickly under a seat and not be seen removing it helps to prevent theft and break-in. I use one for my GPS, and another for a dash cam.</p>
