<h5 id="best-headset-i-ve-bought-in-years">Best Headset I&rsquo;ve Bought in Years!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This headset is one of the best I&rsquo;ve purchased under a strict budget. I tested them out the day I got them, and they&rsquo;re seriously impressive! I&rsquo;m not really into buying the most expensive headphones, as long as they do the job and do it well is all that matters to me.I&rsquo;d first like to discuss the material quality of the headset. It seems that it&rsquo;s made of a flexible yet strong plastic so you won&rsquo;t really need to worry about it snapping in half on you (like some of my previous Turtlebeach ones have). Also, the ear cushions are VERY comfortable. Usually when I get over-the-ear headsets, I can only wear them for about 30 min before my ears start aching. With this headset, I can wear them up to several hours and my ears won&rsquo;t ache. This is great for when I need to work long hours on my laptop while listening to music/videos or take video game breaks for a couple hours. Also, the cushion that supports the top of your head is one of my favorite things about this headset! I hate feeling hard plastic rub against my head, it&rsquo;s pretty headache inducing. With these, I don&rsquo;t have to worry about that! ^__^Next, I want to talk about the sound quality. When it comes to sound either from music or a game, I like to be able to hear the bass that makes sound so rich and clear. I&rsquo;ve heard sounds through my music that I could never hear before thanks to these headphones. And when it comes to games, it&rsquo;s even greater! I play a lot of open world games like Skyrim and Dishonored, and for the first time, I could hear my own footsteps or other characters coming from far away and background noises like birds chirping or the sound of grass rustling. I almost cried, the sound was so beautiful, I&rsquo;m not exaggerating. XDAdditionally, on days when my friend and I play Portal 2 Co-op, I can hear her voice clearly on Skype and I recall her making a comment on how my voice is significantly less muffled and more intelligible. Mind you, to avoid having her be influenced by me stating that I bought new headphones, I didn&rsquo;t mention my new headset until after we finished playing so I could get a genuine comment.Compared to other gaming headphones that I&rsquo;ve had in the past, this one definitely takes the cake. It&rsquo;s affordable, good quality, has an attractive design, and here&rsquo;s a bonus; it lights up when you plug in the USB cord! The mic on the headset can easily be accessed by just pulling it down when you need it and pulling it back up when you don&rsquo;t. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s not the kind of mic where you can adjust how far away it is from your mouth, but that doesn&rsquo;t bother me too much since I don&rsquo;t talk in games too often anyway.The only issues some might come across is the length of the cord. If you have a PS3 and are using these headphones, it might not be long enough to reach your console if you sit kind of far from your TV. However, if you have a PS4, you can just plug it into your controller and you should have no problems.If you&rsquo;re on a tight budget when it comes to gaming gear like I am, this headset is a really nice choice. After buying 4 headsets that ranged from horrible to decent in the past, this one goes above and beyond what I primarily expected from it! I&rsquo;m incredibly happy with it, and I hope it lasts me a long time! :)</p>

<p>I love love love these!!! Plugs right into my PS4 controller !! Also came with splinter cable for my Xbox one as well. They are a quite thick in size but they get the job done</p>

<h5 id="good-headphones">Good headphones.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good headset, and both the sound and mic work great. The only thing I don&rsquo;t like about it is that the sound dial is WAY too easy to turn with my arm or shoulder when I sit against the back of my chair.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&rsquo;re pretty good, comfortable enough, good mic (my friends sometimes complain about that but i sit 4 ft away from my TV so it&rsquo;s probably my fault). The cable is a standard old skool rubber coated cable so it could use some improvement because I think I twisted it a little and now it&rsquo;s fuzzy at certain angles.</p>

<p>Great value for the price, work perfectly with PlayStation and on the laptop using the adapter cord.</p>

<h5 id="great-headset">Great Headset!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered these for my husband about a month ago, and he loves them! They were super easy to set up, maybe 10 minutes in all, although the instruction booklet could have been more helpful (we had to look up tutorials online). The quality of this gaming headset is fantastic, especially for the modest price, and they are very comfortable to wear. My hubby loves finally being able to chat with his gaming buddies. Game on!</p>
