<p>Style:Garmin Dash Cam 35
Garmin Dash Cam 30 and 35 standalone HD driving recorders serve as the eyewitness to your drive. Wide viewing angles provide excellent camera coverage and clear, crisp footage in bright sunlight or low-light conditions. Rely on the Incident Detection (G-sensor) to automatically save footage on impact; files are stored on the replaceable micro SD card (included). Dash Cam 35 adds helpful driver awareness warnings and GPS records exactly when and where incidents occurred. Both models can take still images, from inside or outside your vehicle, to capture close-up collision damage. Play back footage right on the display, or use Garmin Dash CamPlayer to review later on your computer. Notice: Some jurisdictions regulate or prohibit use of this device. It is your responsibility to know and comply with applicable laws and rights to privacy in jurisdictions where you plan to use this device.</p>

<h5 id="a-good-dash-cam-with-some-design-issues-and-the-traffic-camera-notification-costs-extra">A good dash cam with some design issues, and the traffic camera notification costs extra.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Overall this is a very solid dash cam. As background, I&rsquo;ve had a Garmin Dash Cam 20 for about a year. I&rsquo;m putting that camera in my wife&rsquo;s car and I bought the 35 for mine. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Garmin products. The build quality is very good, the unit is compact and lightweight and setup is quick and easy. Video quality at 1080P is excellent and the camera adjusts to changes in light conditions smoothly and well. Night videos are clear and usable. This is a good, reliable choice if you want a no hassle dash cam.So why just three stars? Garmin did some fairly boneheaded things with this unit. As many others have noted, the US version of this product has no audio recording capability. My Dash Cam 20, which Garmin still sells, can record audio and it can be turned on and off in the setup software. If you live in Europe it comes with a microphone. Why on earth Garmin would remove the feature is beyond me. Perhaps someone from Garmin&rsquo;s Automotive Marketing team, who are surely not liking the ratings this product is getting here, will comment and enlighten us.Another design flaw with this camera is the mount. On my Dash Cam 20, the ball mount socket is on the top of the unit. On the 35, they put it right next to the lens. The ball on the suction mount that Garmin sells snaps into the socket just fine (both are 17mm) but because of the placement of the socket, the suction mount itself partially blocks the lens. This isn&rsquo;t a problem with the included adhesive mount, but if you want a Garmin suction mount you&rsquo;re out of luck. I actually called Garmin customer service to ask about this before I bought the unit and was told it would work just fine. And it does, if you don&rsquo;t mind losing about 40% of the field of view of the camera.I liked the idea of having the red light camera and speed camera notification. It&rsquo;s not a big deal for my commute, but it&rsquo;s a nice feature. I assumed it would work out of the box. Fortunately, I read the product FAQ on Garmin&rsquo;s website and found out that it&rsquo;s a subscription service that has to be activated and paid for separately, at $29.95 per year. The sales copy doesn&rsquo;t explicitly say it&rsquo;s included (like the free map updates that have been included on Garmin GPS&rsquo;s for years) but it also doesn&rsquo;t let you know that it&rsquo;s extra. That&rsquo;s not the kind of honest marketing I expect from Garmin.These are all unforced errors on Garmin&rsquo;s part. This is a good product from an engineering standpoint but it does not live up to the high design standards I expect from Garmin. And the head fake on the camera notification is really inexcusable for a reputable company like Garmin</p>

<h5 id="not-bad-i-trust-this-more-than-my-gopro4-silver-just-wish-it-had-audio">Not bad. I trust this more than my GoPro4 Silver. Just wish it had audio.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>(Updated 30 Aug, 2016: added a picture of what the suction cup mount looks like when used with this product; upper left corner)I just got this camera and I must say I&rsquo;m much pleased with it, though it does have a few minor problems. I got this to replace my GoPro4 Silver. I have the DashCam 35. A few things about this camera.It has adjustable resolution of 720p and 1080p. It has a wide screen lens that puts your peripheral vision to shame. It does not have internal memory. It comes with a 4gb microSD card. You can use a microSD card up to 64gb. You can format the microSD card from the command screen. It runs in a loop. It is not touch screen. The screen is 3&rdquo; across. There is a crosshair in the middle so that you can center it. You can choose kph or mph. Mine has twelve possible languages on it. English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Norwegian, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian (for all of those crazy videos!), Finnish, Afrikaans, and Ukrainian (I&rsquo;m guessing on that one). It starts recording as soon as you turn it on. It has a rear placed LED that clearly shows it&rsquo;s recording. There is a button you can press to &ldquo;Save video clip&rdquo;.It mounts to the front by using the socket located next to the lens (more on that later). It is compatible with Garmin Express. From Garmin Express you can download the Garmin DashCam Player video software, and any other updates. You can load Garmin Safety Camera data to it.Your GPS data is displayed in small font across the bottom of the screen. You&rsquo;ll need to have about <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> vision to read it from back in your seat. It tracks your GPS location and speed.Power cord. Same style and length as your standard Garmin GPS cable.USB 2.0 cable. Comes with one, about 15&rdquo;, to attach your camera to your computer.Mount. Garmin screwed up here. The mount adheres to your windshield like a GoPro camera would&ndash;adhesive. This means you cannot move it from one car to another. The good thing is that this mount WILL NOT come lose! However, the other Garmin suction mount works just fine. It may obscure part of your view depending on the angle of your windshield. So if you get this dashcam, and want to move it from car to car, get that Garmin suction mount. Overall though, the included mount is not obtrusive. I had to use a RAM mount for my GoPros, and that thing was an eye sore.USB input. Those bastards screwed this up. The female input slot should be turned in the other direction! The charger cable attaches via an L-shaped male USB input. Unfortunately, the way it plugs in has the cable protruding towards your windshield instead of coming out towards you and easily hanging down towards your 12V DC socket&ndash;if the female input was facing the other way. The manual states it can run for 30 minutes on its own power.Record after power loss. When you turn off your vehicle, you can set this device to turn off in 1 second, 5 seconds, 15 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute.Night driving. The camera has pretty good light gathering capability. So driving at night, the image in your camera is actually brighter than what you see with the naked eye. I was pretty impressed. Much better than my GoPro4 Silver. I&rsquo;ve also noticed that it has an auto-dim feature that darkens the screen while driving. I, at first, thought this annoying, but came to accept it as it has the benefit of looking as if it is off by those looking into your car, but you can clearly see that it&rsquo;s on.Playback. You can playback from the camera. However, you can only view those videos [UPDATE 3 May 16] that it automatically saves (ie: notifies you on the screen that it just saved the clip) and those you manually SAVED by pressing the bottom button to save that clip. That is to say, you finish driving and press the bottom button, now you can view THAT clip from when it turned on, until you pressed the button. All other recordings&ndash;UNSAVED&ndash; you can only access through the computer (Garmin software viewer). So if you do not press the bottom (save video clip) button, then the recording is still there, but you need to go through the program to view it. Files are saved in the MP4 format in 60mb clips. The Garmin software merges those clips together in larger segments that begin from when it turns on, until it turns off.Overheating. This is a major problem with my GoPro4 Silver as it was with my GoPro3 Silver. Those cameras were always overheating and then shutting off. I have a Garmin Nuvi 56 which is rated at 140°F. It has never overheated on me. This camera is rated 131°F.Proximity Warning. This feature warns you if you are too close to a car based upon your speed. I had mine set to medium. I was doing about 60mph and about four cars back from a car in front of me. The entire screen would turn red with a car and radar icon (you can see no recording), and stay that way until it deemed I was far enough back. I got home and turned this feature off!Audio. No audio! Needs to record audio. Recommend some of the other Garmin items if you want audio.Good camera over all. Garmin needs to fix the USB input (rotate it counter-clockwise, down 90°), include a suction mount, and add audio.*****I just got the UK version and it does record audio (you can turn this feature on or off). It&rsquo;s in one of the drop down lists. It also came built in with the traffic camera subscription for Western Europe. I do not recommend getting this feature with either dashcam. When you hit a safety/radar camera zone, just like the collision warning, it beeps, the entire screen goes red and fills with &ldquo;Fixed Camera Zone&rdquo;, etc. It does not tell you where it is at, but just that one is in the vicinity. I turned it off. It still films, but I did not like my screen going solid red, or grey, or whatever. The video captures this. The cameras are at the 20 second mark on the left and right sides of the road.I&rsquo;ve uploaded a video of the UK version. It&rsquo;s the UK version&ndash;with audio. I give the UK version 5 stars. I found the sound quality to be outstanding.</p>
