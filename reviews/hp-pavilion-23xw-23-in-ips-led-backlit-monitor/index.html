<h5 id="one-of-the-best-if-not-the-best-looking-monitor-on-the-market">One of the best (if not THE best) looking monitor on the market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has to be the one of the best (if not THE best) looking monitor on the market. Hp really took a number from Apple&rsquo;s play book w/ this monitor &amp; I for one am impressed. The color reproduction is phenomenal (considering it&rsquo;s 1080p on a 25&rdquo; monitor) &amp; I barely had to do any tweaking out of the box to get it to my preference. Furthermore, the menu is very easy to navigate &ndash; many monitors fail in this dept. &ndash; &amp; I found myself breezing thru it in a matter of secs w/ out looking at the owners manual. I appreciate the 2 HDMI ports in the back for simultaneous input options.Lastly, if any Mac owners find their the HP 25xw&rsquo;s monitor image &amp; text to be fuzzy out of the box, in the menu go to: &ldquo;Image Control&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; &ldquo;Overscan&rdquo; &amp; set it to &ldquo;OFF.&rdquo; After that, the display was perfect.** UPDATE (February 2016) **Been using this monitor for 4 months now and still LOVE it. I leave it on <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> (it goes to standby mode when not in use) because I often connect my Macbook Air to it using a HDMI to mini display port cable whenever am at my desk. That way I don&rsquo;t have to turn it on manually every time.It wakes up effortlessly once connected to my Mac &amp; goes to sleep once I disconnect it. Moreover, I have my PS4 connected to the second HDMI port and the games look awesome with no lag.</p>

<h5 id="so-impressed-crisp-image-great-with-my-macbook">So impressed! Crisp image, great with my MacBook.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Plugged it into my MacBook Pro (13 inch, Late 2013) via the HDMI ports of both devices and it worked immediately! And the image is so crisp, I could hardly believe it. It may not be a Retina display, but I consider it to be as close as you can get without shelling out a fortune for the Mac thunderbolt display.Very relieved that this worked after I bought a Dell monitor last week that just would not work with my computer. Also, it&rsquo;s a very nice, sleek design that looks good with the MacBook. Don&rsquo;t search any further than this for a second monitor if you wanna stay on the cheaper end.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="definitely-a-4-star-monitor">Definitely a 4 Star Monitor</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is definitely a 4 star monitor. Display is pretty crisp. Colors are accurate, I guess. It looks good and works well with my Mac mini 2012. I like that the Mac mini fits on the base of the stand, so it&rsquo;s almost like having an all-in-one&hellip; kinda sort of. The only bad points I can think of is that the display has small bezels, but the display area itself does not go from bezel to bezel, rather there is still some additional space between the bezel and where the screen starts. The other thing is that there is visible backlight bleed on the lower right corner of the screen. IPS screens have bleed, but this is more to do with the design of the housing, it has a gap that makes the light more visible. Lastly there was some tape on the housing that held a cardboard cover to protect the screen. Unfortunately removing the tape left some residue on the display housing, and it&rsquo;s pretty visible and I&rsquo;ve had no luck removing it.</p>

<h5 id="these-are-great-monitors-but-if-you-want-to-buy-2-of-them-read-this-first">These Are Great Monitors But IF You want To Buy 2 Of Them READ THIS FIRST!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great monitors love them, great quality and 27inch is plenty big enough to get your work done or just enjoy whatever it is you enjoy on your computer.One issue I came across in my setup was I have 2 of these and when I am watching Netflix on one and turn off the other one and go back to turn it back on it will not feed me any image, says the HDMI is active and everything but just wont feed me the computer screen. What I found out and don&rsquo;t know why (and might just be my setup) is when I closed the Netflix browser the 2nd screen comes on automatically. So try that if you find you 2nd monitor is not coming back on.Another issue since I order 2 of them The colors didn&rsquo;t match out the box and that irked me cause I have a very clean setup and very particular how things look but I tweaked color the settings (RGB) and they matched up just fine so was happy and glad I didn&rsquo;t listen to that one review that said the color doesn&rsquo;t match. One thing to keep in mind the color issue is only an issue with the whites, the other colors matched perfectly.</p>

<h5 id="poor-picture-quality">Poor picture quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, I am quite disappointed with the quality of this monitor. After reading the rave reviews I was sure I would love it&hellip;Physically it is impressive&hellip;.but the picture quality is just plain dull&hellip;.not as vibrant as the Asus it replaced&hellip;.I&rsquo;ve tried every setting, brightness nearly to 100&hellip;.makes no difference&hellip;.and as I&rsquo;m out of the US&hellip;.returning it is not an option&hellip;.sad</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fantastic-monitor-with-a-great-picture">Fantastic Monitor With A Great Picture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A superb monitor, one of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve ever made. I bought the 27 inch model of this monitor when it was on sale over the summer and it has surpassed all of my expectations. The picture is amazing, and the size is great for gaming, working or watching TV. I use this monitor for everything. The width is plenty wide to allow for 2 webpages to be opened at the same time side by side and still feel like they are their full pages. I am also an avid gamer and have used this to play a number of rpg, fps, and mmo games. I&rsquo;ve always found it&rsquo;s responsiveness to be great and it provides a great picture. The design is also fantastic, it has a very simple and sleek look that will fit in great with almost any system setup. I&rsquo;ve also enjoyed the 2 HDMI ports and the simple setup. This monitor will work with any PC or console right out of the box without any adjusting. Overall I highly recommend this monitor.</p>

<h5 id="beautiful-bright-image-right-out-of-the-box">Beautiful, Bright Image right out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Disclaimer: I&rsquo;ve only had this monitor for two days, but I&rsquo;m so impressed with it I had to write a review. The image quality on this monitor is amazing! I had ordered an AOC monitor first because it had built-in speakers, but when I plugged that one in, the image was grainy and the colors were all off. Even after tuning the monitor and adjusting it according to the instructions, the image was sub-par. Not so with the HP monitor. I plugged it in, and immediately loved what I saw. In fact, it even looks better than my MacBook Pro&rsquo;s Retina display in terms of vibrancy and color (the MBP has a much denser pixel quality, and is an awesome screen on its own). Because of the difference in pixels per inch, there is a shift in size when I drag items from one screen to the other, but I can get used to that. I use an ACER monitor at work, and was happy with that model, but the HP blows it away in terms of image sharpness and quality. Overall, I am very impressed with this monitor.</p>

<h5 id="i-m-not-pretty-sure-why">I&rsquo;m not pretty sure why</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The monitor sometimes appear irritating line on it many times! I&rsquo;m not pretty sure why. I changed into 3 other HDMI cable to check whether the cable is the problem, but it appears&hellip;</p>
