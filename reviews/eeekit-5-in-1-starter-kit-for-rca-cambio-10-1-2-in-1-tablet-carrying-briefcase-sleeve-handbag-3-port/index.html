<h5 id="not-bad-for-the-money">Not bad for the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Not bad for the money. I hate to nit-pick, but the bag starts getting bulky when you include all the accessories especially with the mouse(more on this later) and the tablet inside. Another thing is that the zippers do not lock in place if you are using the handle. There is a flap that you fold through the handles and over which secures the top of the bag with Velcro, but the 2 zippers on the sides of the bag can easily slip open letting your tablet come tumbling down on the hard floor. I&rsquo;m not sure why they designed it like that ? Due to this design I do not feel totally comfortable lugging my tablet around in this bag with the handle. Another thing is the slick ultra-thin mouse. Sure the mouse is ultra thin and looks sleek, but it is made of cheap plastic, the kind of plastic used in less than $5 toys. I once dropped it from about 2 feet and the mouse stopped working ! I had to do some skillful twisting to get it to work again. Other than that, everything else works and the extra accessories might and do come in handy.</p>

<h5 id="great-case-for-your-rca-11-maven-pro">Great case for your RCA 11 Maven Pro</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After shopping around for a case for my daughters Maven Pro I ended up choosing the 5-in-1 starter kit for 2 reasons: 1. It was designed to fit the Maven Pro specifically and 2. None of the other cases had such a great deal! I&rsquo;m very happy with it. It fits perfectly, and it came with everything advertised. The mouse is simple for even a 5year old to connect, but does not come with batteries (2AAA), it does come with a convenient storage pouch though. The HDMI cord is about 6ft and the USB port comes in really handy seeing how the tablet only has 1 USB plugin. It also came with a ball point pen/stylus. Overall I am very happy with the quality of everything in the kit and that everything came as advertised.</p>

<h5 id="hioji">hioji</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the case. The carrying case is made of good thick fabric for added protection but the zipper seems to be a bit on the cheap side. Also, the case does not allow for any room for the accessories or the cover that I have on my Maven. Next are the accessories that comes with this case, which in my case are worth the $25. I haven&rsquo;t tried the multi port USB or the HDMI yet, but they seem to be as good as any other you would buy. The ear speakers are of good quality with a crisp clean sounds that can go louder than you should allow. The mouse is of less quality. Though it is responsive as any laser mouse should be and also works with a variety of electronics which is a real plus for me. The thing I liked the most is the small carrying bag to store all the goodies in, which in my opinion it is the highest quality of any thing sold in this combo deal. Would I suggest this to a friend yes, but was disappointed that the case left absolutely no room for anything but the a bare tablet. Zipper will not close fully with my tablet&rsquo;s cover.</p>

<h5 id="great-kit">Great kit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great kit. Wireless mouse is very sturdy. You need the micro hdmi to play tablet to TV. The case fits well and is well padded. I didn&rsquo;t use the USB hub, it won&rsquo;t fit in the case with it in on. Also, didn&rsquo;t use the headphones. The mouse, cable and case made it worth the price for me.</p>

<h5 id="i-recommend-for-anyone-with-a-12-inch-laptop-tablet-or-smaller">I recommend for anyone with a 12 inch laptop/tablet or smaller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First off, shipping was quick without prime. Second, the sellers were great at responding to my emails.Third, decent items for the price.My mini hdmi to hdmi cable wasn&rsquo;t function well so I emailed the sellers and in less than a day I got a response and in about two days after i received the replacement as well.Mouse is decent, haven&rsquo;t had any issues.Mouse pad is a nice size.The usb extender is nice as well.Comes in a neat pouch to put all your laptop accessories.The bag won&rsquo;t provide much protection from drops or any weight but at the price you can&rsquo;t beat it.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-missing-a-piece-that-goes-with-the-mouse">I am missing a piece that goes with the mouse &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am missing a piece that goes with the mouse. How am I supposed to use the mouse without it? The case itself is way too big for the tablet/laptop. No receipt or packing slip was included in the box.</p>

<h5 id="do-not-waste-your-hard-earned-money-buyer-beware">DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY&hellip;..BUYER BEWARE!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>If I could give this seller and product no stars, I would have! The product is CHEAPLY made, the case DOES NOT fit an 11 Maven Pro tablet as advertised. If you have already ordered it and need to return the product, it needs to be damaged first. They WILL CHARGE you to return an UNDAMAGED product! DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.</p>
