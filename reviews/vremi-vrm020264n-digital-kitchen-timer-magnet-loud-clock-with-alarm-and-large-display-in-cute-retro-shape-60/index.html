<h5 id="great-kitchen-timer-easy-to-use">Great kitchen timer; easy to use!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Vremi has once again knocked it out of the park with their kitchen timer aka The Foodie Countdown. First of all, they have the cutest packaging and the included manual is helpful and easy to read. The timer has an included AAA battery (note: it was a little hard to get out of the compartment as it was wrapped in plastic to prolong life, but a plastic card popped it right out. Reinstallation was easy) and three modes; clock, stopwatch and countdown timer. Using the included manual, it was very easy to program in both modes, but simplistic enough that the manual was not necessary. The tone of the alarm is loud (check out my video) and appropriate, i.e., not startling. My favorite feature is the magnetic back, great for sticking on the fridge or NEAR (not on) the grill. There is also a little stand for table top use. I highly recommend this little product and consider it a homerun.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-big-display">Nice, big display</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing is wonderful. I love the big display. It is very easy to see. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s great for the kitchen, but I am a teacher. So I&rsquo;m actually using it for my classroom. The magnet is perfect to hang on my white board. The kids can see it real easily when they are being timed for specific projects. The stopwatch function is great, too. So I can use it either direction with ease. When the timer is not being used, it&rsquo;s another great clock. What I love the best is that now I no longer worry about setting a timer down and losing it. I also don&rsquo;t have to worry about using my phone and having the sleep function wipe out the display. I will probably a a couple more of these for my home as well!</p>

<h5 id="i-love-not-only-this-great-looking">I love not only this great looking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love not only this great looking, easy to use clock/timer, but also the vendor and their concern for pleasing a customer! When mine arrived, I could not get it into 12 hour mode, showing PM. I called for information, and without any problem at all, was asked for my order number and received its replacement the following day! Now THAT is excellent service! I guess it&rsquo;s why I shop Amazon! Vremi Digital Kitchen Timer Magnet - Loud Magnetic Kitchen Timer Clock with Alarm and Large Display in Cute Retro Shape - 60 Minute 24 Hour Electric Timer with Stopwatch - Red&hellip;AND, it matches my new red Hamilton Beach Toaster Oven!</p>

<h5 id="very-versatile-product">very versatile product!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome little timer-Vremi does such a good job with their products-i have many of them and just love each and every one-they are packaged wonderfully-you can take this anywhere in your home-sometimes because of the way your house is laid out you might not hear the timer go off but like i said you can take it with you put it in your pocket because it has a small footprint-it has a great holding magnet to put on anything that is metal aka refrigerator/stove also it has a stand so it can just sit on your counter-it has multiple functions and is so easy to use-the price you cant beat for such a versatile product-i highly recommend it!!!</p>

<h5 id="sleek-little-timer">sleek little timer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the vremi digital kitchen timer magnet because I feel I&rsquo;m always using multiple timers in the kitchen between the oven, microwave and my cell phone. The sleek design is nice to fit anywhere magnetic in your kitchen, I currently have mine on the fridge, but also has the capability to be on the counter with its kick out stand. Another great feature that this little timer has is that its also a clock. The large display is easily read from a distance back even with me being near sighted. Most things don&rsquo;t come battery included and vremi sends a AAA battery already in place for you ready to go its nice to be able to set up immediately and begin using without worrying about if I have a battery and of that size. Nice big buttons on the top for MODE:HOUR:MIN:SEC:START/STOP to set the clock and the timer. All in all highly recommended little timer/clock for any all needs from the busy mom, the work out enthusiast, to the cook in the family, to the teacher.</p>

<h5 id="loud-great-magnet-easy-to-use">Loud, great magnet, easy to use.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Super sturdy magnetic kitchen timer. There are so many uses for a kitchen timer besides just cooking (especially if you have kids!). I love that this magnet is strong and not flimsy at all. It is a perfect addition to my kitchen when I am tracking multiple cooking times. Now I don&rsquo;t have to set the oven three different ways and remember to &ldquo;add 5 minutes after the first time for this and 7 minutes after that for this&rdquo; type cooking. This guy is easy and intuitive to use. I will tell you it is LOUD. Like really loud! You&rsquo;ll hear it outside&hellip;..or on a different floor. And there&rsquo;s no way your kids can say they didn&rsquo;t hear it :)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-quality-easy-to-use-love-it">Great quality, easy to use. Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was so happy to receive this so I could throw away my old kitchen timer! This one is much more substantial than our old one and screams higher quality. It&rsquo;s got a nice little stand you can pull out of the back, like on a picture frame, so this can sit on the counter too. It takes a single AAA battery instead of one of those button batteries you never have on hand. I Love that this can be used as a clock when not being used as a timer. The buttons on the top are easy to use, and flipping between modes and clearing settings was a breeze to figure out. I also appreciated the enclosed instructions being simple, easy to follow, and written in clear English. This was a great purchase!</p>

<h5 id="this-came-very-quickly-and-feels-like-a-quality-product">This came very quickly and feels like a quality product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This came very quickly and feels like a quality product, not just a cheap timer. I like how easy it is to program and use and that it displays the time and can be stuck to the fridge with avmagnet or set on a flat surface with the handy built-in collapsible stand. It has an easily replaceable AAA battery instead of dangerous and expensive button batteries. The battery came in protective plastic so it wouldn&rsquo;t run down.The only con I could think of is that it makes a pretty loud beep with every button push while setting it so if you&rsquo;re by a sleeping baby you may want to keep that in mind.Overall I&rsquo;m very pleased with this product.</p>
