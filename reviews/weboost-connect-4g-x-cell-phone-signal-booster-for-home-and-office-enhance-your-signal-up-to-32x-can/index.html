<h5 id="this-really-works">This REALLY Works!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using cell boosters in my house for several years now - and the technology has come a long way in that time!When you read reviews, you&rsquo;ll typically find that most reviewers fall into one of these three groups:Group #1: It works great, my whole house now has 5 bars of coverage!Group #2: It works OK right around the indoor antenna - but the range isn&rsquo;t very far&hellip;Group #3: This sucks, it doesn&rsquo;t do anything at all!It takes a bit more work to be in group #1; but, the effort is definitely worth it! In this review, I&rsquo;m going to go through my experience with the install to hopefully help anybody who is considering purchasing this.[*** Outdoor Coverage <strong><em>]The first thing to keep in mind with these boosters is that they are attempting to bring the outside cell signal into your house. As a result, if you don&rsquo;t have a good signal outside, this booster kit isn&rsquo;t going to buy you much - and you&rsquo;ll wind up solidly in Group #3.Honestly, if you walk outside and don&rsquo;t have a cell signal you shouldn&rsquo;t even try this.In my case, we have a radiant barrier in our attic that is great for utilities - but kills our indoor cell signal. Without the booster, we were lucky to have any signal at all in the house, even though there was a very solid 4-5 bar signal in the yard. As a result, we&rsquo;re the perfect candidates for this type of booster.[</em></strong> Antenna Separation <strong><em>]For people who do have a solid signal outside, the biggest thing that divides people in Group #2 from those in Group #1 is the amount of separation between the indoor and outdoor antennas.It&rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of thinking maybe another indoor antenna will help your coverage; but, in reality, the best way to boost coverage is to simply increase the separation between the indoor and outdoor antennas.The reason separation is so important is because the indoor booster antenna signal can actually reach the outdoor antenna and cause feedback that shuts down the whole system. As a result, the indoor booster will detect the feedback and turn down its own power - which decreases the indoor range significantly.There are several things you can do to increase the separation between the antennas:1) This kit includes a directional antenna; and, even though it&rsquo;s a bit harder to aim it, it does increase the separation significantly since it&rsquo;s aimed at the cell tower and tends to not &lsquo;see&rsquo; your indoor booster antenna.Keep in mind that the cell network in the U.S. is growing quickly, so you may need to re-aim your antenna periodically if a new cell tower comes online in your area.2) Physical distance between the indoor and outdoor antennas is critical, but insulating materials work far better than open air space. In my case, the radiant barrier actually works in my favor since it provides greater separation between the indoor and outdoor units.3) Coax cable quality also makes a big difference since you can have some feedback from the indoor signal through the coax cable if you use a poorly insulated cable. Fortunately, this kit provides a good cable - unlike some of the other kits I&rsquo;ve messed with.Providing good separation between the indoor and outdoor antennas is definitely more work; but, it truly does make a huge difference to the effectiveness of this booster![</em></strong> Conclusion ***]For me, this has been an absolutely amazing booster!Without the booster, we were lucky to have any signal in the house at all - with constant missed calls; or, being forced to talk out in the yard. Anybody looking at this product probably knows exactly what I&rsquo;m talking about. :)We have a 2-story/3,000 square foot home - and this booster covers the entire house with a solid 5-bar signal!If you have a good cell signal outside, and are willing to take an afternoon to get this installed correctly, then I would definitely recommend giving it a try.</p>

<h5 id="this-booster-did-not-work-in-my-location">This booster did not work in my location</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This booster did not work in my location. I have a Verizon phone and need good 4G LTE data bandwidth. My location is in the mountains about 5-6 miles from where cell towers are. As it turns out, Verizon LTE is in band 13 (746-787 Mhz) and AT&amp;T operates LTE in the adjacent band 17 (734-746Mhz). The result is that the booster goes into an overload situation (&ldquo;cell tower too strong&rdquo;) and reduces the gain on the 700Mhz band (it shows an orange/green flashing LED). On the 3G bands there is no overload and the booster operates at full gain (solid green LED). The effect on the phone is two-fold: one, the indoor LTE signal is relatively weak, so I have to be a few feet from the indoor antenna to get an OK LTE signal, but worse, the phone switches to 3G because that signal is so much stronger (full boost). That makes the unit unusable for me.I spent a week exchanging emails and troubleshooting with WeBoost. The support is very helpful and level-2 is definitely knowledgeable. One big issue, however, is that emails to support only reach the level-1 team and the ticket that is created with all the info sent in cannot be seen by level-2. I emailed spectrum analyzer scans and those are over the head of level-1 support and when I called level-2 they couldn&rsquo;t access them! Come on, we&rsquo;re in 2016&hellip; It took two days for someone in level-1 to forward the info I sent in to a manager in L-2 and then I had to reach that person and he had a hard time accessing the info. Frustrating after having spent over an hour performing spectrum scans and typing explanations in.For reference: I used the excellent Android Advanced Signal Status app to show 3G voice signal strength and separately LTE signal strength. Holding my phone up at the antenna location up above the roof I get around: CDMA -75dB RSSI, LTE -65dB RSSI, LTE -94dB RSRP. A bandwidth test up there yields ~5-6Mbps down and 10-11Mbps up. Inside the house I get zilch. With the booster I end up with CDMA -50dB RSSI, and LTE -66dB RSSI and -89dB RSRP. That shows pretty clear that the CDMA is boosted more than LTE and thus the phone gets confused. If I lock the phone to LTE using field test mode I get 2-3Mbps down and 4-5Mbps up, but that&rsquo;s not a usable state (no SMS and no voice calls).In the end, I have the feeling that the device has a flaw and cannot properly deal with both LTE carriers in the 700Mhz band. I&rsquo;m returning the unit and will try a surecall unit that has individual manual gain adjustment per band so if I end up having the same problem at least I can turn down 3G to match LTE.For the curious, I&rsquo;m attaching a spectrum scan from 650-900 Mhz taken through the booster&rsquo;s directional antenna, so it&rsquo;s exactly what the booster sees as input. From the left you can see the AT&amp;T downlink between 734Mhz and 744Mhz (that&rsquo;s the first bunch of signals hitting the green) and then right next to it the Verizon downlink from 746-756Mhz (that&rsquo;s the second bunch of signals). After that there&rsquo;s not much until it gets above 850Mhz. (BTW, these scans were taken with a $20 DVB-T USB dongle and the RTLSDR program!)I&rsquo;m attaching a second scan taken of the boosted signal indoors (that&rsquo;s the image with the pink selection in the middle-right). This one is narrower and shows just the AT&amp;T and Verizon downlinks. What I find curious is that the AT&amp;T signal (on the left) is boosted more than the Verizon signal (on the right highlighted in pink) even though in the scan above both are very close in intensity. Folks at WeBoost couldn&rsquo;t explain that.In the end I&rsquo;m giving the unit 4 stars &lsquo;cause it does work but just cannot deal with my situation (which doesn&rsquo;t seem that uncommon), and because there is support, and because I can easily return it within 30 days. If you are considering a booster my recommendations are: (1) do not buy any unit under any circumstance that you cannot return if it doesn&rsquo;t work to your satisfaction, and (2) try it out using temporary antenna mounts and cable feed-throughs as soon as possible so you have time to work with support if it doesn&rsquo;t just work.Update 4/24/2016: After returning this unit I purchased a SureCall Fusion4Home and so far that has worked much better. I do not know whether it boosts any better or not, but the LEDs provide more information and the manual gain adjustments have allowed me to tune 3G vs. 4G. The manual gain adjustments also make it easier to troubleshoot one band at a time and to see which bands each of my devices is actually using (for example AT&amp;T uses 3 bands here and one of my phones only supports two of them).</p>
