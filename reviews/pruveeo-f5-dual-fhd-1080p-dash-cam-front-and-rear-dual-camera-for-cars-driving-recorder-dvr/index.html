<h5 id="im-new-to-the-dash-cam-world-but-i-do-recommend-this-one">Im new to the dash cam world, but i do recommend this one</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>March 18, 2017I&rsquo;ve had this dashcam for a few days now and I&rsquo;m very happy with it. The resolution of the front cam is great. I can see the license plates clearly from the videos. The back camera however is poor, but it&rsquo;s better than nothing.When i hid the rear camera wire, the length of the rear cam wire is a bit short, considering i drive a small sedan.The unit comes with two 3m mounting plates. So if you have 2 vehicles, you can mount both plates on them and you can switch them around. Which is perfect for me.Umm. Once installed, the cam looks like part of the car. You really can&rsquo;t tell it&rsquo;s there.I’m new to the dash cam world, but I do recommend this camera for the price and quality compared to other brands.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-am-happy-with-this-dash-cam">I am happy with this dash cam.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been using this dash for week and really happy with its performance. First, its manual is well written which made installation and set up easy. Second, I like this dash cam because it mounts very closely the windshields.  It reduces the distortion unlike some other dash cams I’ve tried. Thirdly, its front camera is excellent. The videos are crispy clear during day time and it support 128g SD card! One downside is that I wish the cable for the rear camera could be longer. It is too short for my Minivan however I could easily fix this problem by buying a longer cable and installed it on the back camera. Overall, This is a very solid dash cam in a reasonable price range.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-not-bad-as-all">it is not bad as all</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is actually much easier to setup than I initially thought it to be. There are 2 lines, one connect to power, one goes to the back of the car as rearview camera. The rearview line is harder because it is longer distance and I have to hide it well. Overall, it is not bad as all, after little over an hour, wiring was done, and monitor is attached to windshield. It is plug and play and work right the way. The manual is also quite simple for me, not too many buttons. The LCD screen with menu definitely a plus, easy to browse and alter setting to see how they works. Also I like it has 1080pixels recording, even though, it consume more space, and high definition for me is a big plus. Try to buy a big SD card thus, which I did bought a 128GB. Good dash cam and rearview cam combined, all in one, great product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="installing-the-front-camera-is-super-easy-just-find-the-spot-on-the-windshield">Installing the front camera is super easy, just find the spot on the windshield &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Order this set of dash camera to replacement my previous one. Installing the front camera is super easy, just find the spot on the windshield that you wanted and stick it on. The adhesive is very strong wouldn’t worry about falling off. It came with rear view camera that I near used before, I did spent a little extra time wiring the rear camera, but it was all worth it. The video results are great for both from and rear camera. Now I can drive on the road with a peace of mind.</p>

<h5 id="dash-cam-for-my-small-old-car-to-ensure-better-road-safety">&hellip; Dash Cam for my small old car to ensure better road safety</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I plan to buy a Dash Cam for my small old car to ensure better road safety. It&rsquo;s better to have front and back cameras coming.Finally I found a good choice. It&rsquo;s very easy to install the Dash Cam into the car. The product is working great. After downloading the video footage to my laptop, the video quality is very living, full high definition format.</p>

<p>This dash cam is smaller than it looks on the listing and with a low profile design which attracts less attention. Just stick it on the windshield and no one is going to notice.
