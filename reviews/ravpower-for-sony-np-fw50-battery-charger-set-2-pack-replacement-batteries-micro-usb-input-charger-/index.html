<h5 id="powerful-charger-less-powerful-batteries">Powerful Charger, Less Powerful Batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s my intent for this review to be helpful to you, and if you only read one, read this one.Here is my impression; I&rsquo;ve tried to hit the points you need to know, and constantly update this review.In general, everything is put together well, from the packaging, to the way pieces connect. Unit feels sturdy and does not emit heat during charging, even if left plugged in for extended periods of time. One battery arrived at about 80% while the other was empty, here&rsquo;s the info I have so far regarding actual power (updated accordingly):-The capacity of the batteries on a Sony Alpha 6000 lasts nearly equally of around 300 shots (Sony&rsquo;s claimed amount) or 3 hours of intermittent shooting (I will more thoroughly test this and update accordingly).-Included batteries seem to unpreventably lose their charge over time, as much as 10% per day.-The charger charges empty batteries fully in about 2.25hrs.-Sony OEM batteries obviously do fit in the charger, too.So far the only thing I could foresee people disliking is the cable, which is of a thin, ribbon type. I don&rsquo;t mind because it&rsquo;s more tangle-free.To conclude, this is an incredible deal. Would you rather have one genuine Sony battery for $40, or two similar batteries that you just have to charge often PLUS a charger for half the price? To me it&rsquo;s a no-brainer otherwise. :)*NINE-MONTH UPDATE*This charger&rsquo;s still spitting out fully and quickly-charged batteries! I still stand by my recommendation that you obtain this product.</p>

<h5 id="great-value-on-battery-and-charger">Great value on battery and charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The battery charger works very well and has a straightforward red green rechargeable light. The batteries that were supplied don&rsquo;t seem to be quite as long lasting as my original Sony battery. But the value The price that I paid for these makes it a non-issue and an incredible value. I would definitely buy it again.</p>

<h5 id="misplaced-configuration">Misplaced configuration</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Exactly as shown in the product information.Good package.2 Batteries1 Double Charger1 USB cable 0.66mtsBatteries works fine with my Sony A7 mark IIThe charger it&rsquo;s very handy and portable with their low profile style, I&rsquo;ve used to have a bulky one earlier.The included USB to micro USB cable it&rsquo;s reasonably long and with a flat cable, perfect to wrap in a small place.The only BIG issue it&rsquo;s the order of charging status LED&rsquo;s vs batteries slots! It&rsquo;s very confusing.It&rsquo;s correctly labeled, left to right LED CH1 then LED CH2, but the batteries are the upper one CH2 and the lower one CH1.So your first reaction when you see Green (Fully Charged) CH1 it&rsquo;s to pull the battery on the top, but this is the CH2!Not really a big deal, but it&rsquo;s confusing.Overall, for this price point it&rsquo;s a good purchase</p>

<h5 id="works-as-expected">Works As Expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fantastic addition for me. There isn&rsquo;t much to say. I love the fact that I can plug these into my computer and charge the batteries up. It charges fast and I haven&rsquo;t run into any issues with the charger. I love the small size as well. Very low profile and easily fits in the bag. The batteries definitely don&rsquo;t last as long as the originals - no doubt - but they do the job.</p>

<h5 id="amazed-with-the-built-quality">AMAZED WITH THE BUILT QUALITY</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>excellent built quality. Was very surprised with the quality; the device was actually very well constructed and built considering the price that i had paid with 2 extra batteries in the same package. Im very sure the price will be increased in no time soon. One of the best i have tried so far; small portable yet functional. Love the microusb port that make charging easy on the go with any battery bank.LOVE IT TO BITS</p>

<h5 id="definitely-worth-the-money">Definitely worth the money</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this unit so that I could charge up multiple batteries for my Sony A6000, as I was tired of having to connect the camera to charge one battery at a time. My Sony goes through batteries pretty quickly and I would often end up with two burned out batteries and no camera to use until they were recharged :(I love the fact that you can charge 2 different batteries at the same time without tying up the camera for hours waiting for one battery to charge. Double bonus is that this RAVPower came with a couple of throw-in batteries (which I have honestly not used yet so cannot say how good/bad they are&ndash;but if you can get even 50 pictures out them, then hey, that&rsquo;s fantastic). Triple bonus is that this unit was under $30 when I bought it including the extra batteries.The packaging this unit came in is very professional looking. If you register the product, you get an additional 12 months extended warranty. I can&rsquo;t find anything not to like about this so far. Great product.</p>

<h5 id="buy-it-now-and-save-yourself-the-headache">Buy it now and save yourself the headache</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great quality for this deal of a price. I hate only being able to charge one battery by plugging it into my Sony a7 but this thing solves it and comes with two batteries. If you&rsquo;re having any doubts just get this, it makes charging your Sony so much easier. Sure the batteries aren&rsquo;t Sony level quality but they work and hold a decent charge - charges my Sony batteries great with no noticeable issues (Sony batteries do hold a charge better than these though). I just carry around the case with batteries stored in the slots for a compact carrying and charging station. 100% best decision buying this since I got the Sony a7.</p>
