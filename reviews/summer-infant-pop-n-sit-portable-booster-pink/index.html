<h5 id="not-the-same-as-the-picture">Not the same as the picture.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The seatbelt in the picture is sewn in the backing of the chair. The chair I received, the seatbelt was sewn into the bottom back area of the seat. When I put my son in the seat he almost fell out from the side when he went to reach for something. I love the chair but I&rsquo;m sending it back. I&rsquo;m not sure if I got a defective chair. If someone from Summer Infant could contact me that would be great.</p>

<h5 id="impressive-little-travel-high-chair">Impressive little travel high chair!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Surprisingly good! We used this for vacation for our 1 year old and it worked well. We strapped it to a regular chair. The tray is small so you need to put smaller bowls on or use directly the top of the tray. Given the size is smaller I think you get more mess with the little ones than the larger chairs. Overall for the price it is impressive, folds well, it fit in our suitcase easily without issue and was easily opened and closed. We keep it around now for play dates for friends to use for our little visitors. Good option for travel!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-for-a-1-year-old-camping-beach-chair">Love for a 1-Year Old Camping/Beach Chair</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far we really love this traveling high chair. We purchased it to use as a low to the ground beach/camping chair for our one year old, and it is perfect for that purpose. I reduced one start for two reasons: the chair is hard to close, which is great from a safety standpoint but frustrating to put away (a locking mechanism might have been better), and the soft sides do nothing to prevent our child from leaning over and falling out, so we never use this chair up high off the ground (which I believe was part of their intended purpose).READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="great-for-traveling">Great for traveling</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is definitely useful. We&rsquo;ve taken it on many trips and it is so nice to have a little highchair we can plop on a chair or just sit on the floor. My only problem with it is the tray. It does occasionally pop off when I&rsquo;m positive that I pushed it on all the way. I always make sure to have my daughter strapped in tight so when this happens she can&rsquo;t take a dive. Besides that, I love it. The straps for securing it to a chair are so useful and I love that it folds up and has a little bag to put it into so it is easy to take with when traveling.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="wonderful-chair-nicely-constructed">Wonderful chair, nicely constructed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>LOVE this chair. Perfect size for our toddler child. He loves to sit in it. We don&rsquo;t use the tray though, but he has eaten out of it plenty of times. He clearly gets a lot of pleasure sitting in this chair that is just his size, esp. when we&rsquo;re out at outdoor concerts, picnics&hellip; I think it really helps him feel more at ease and not like everything is just so big in this great big world! ;) Nice and sturdy, well made, we love the carry / tote bag, too (makes it very easy to store under his stroller and just grab and go)&hellip;READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-chair">Love this chair!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I researched a few styles of on the go highchairs and ended up with this one for when my son turned 8 months. I am giving it 5 stars because the quality is great, it is easy to use and I know we can get a couple years out of it. The only thing that I don&rsquo;t like is that the suction plate that I have will not fit on the tray, but thats not a deal breaker for me to want to return this item. It is super easy to throw and keep in the back of the car, or take to a friends house and bring with us in the bottom of the stroller. Highly recommended!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="love-this-booster-chair">Love this booster chair</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love this booster chair! Recently purchased this for a camping trip, and it was a real life-saver. It&rsquo;s so lightweight and compact, you can pretty much take it anywhere. You can leave it on the floor or strap it to a chair or bench. It was easy to set up and the tray detaches for easy washing. My child is a small 1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>-year-old and fit in the seat &amp; belt just fine. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a suitable size for up to that age if your child is average size or bigger. Even after my child outgrows it, I&rsquo;ll probably hold onto it in case we need to use it for visitors.READ MORE</p>
