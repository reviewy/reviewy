<h5 id="great-light-needs-packaging-improvement">Great light, needs packaging improvement</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this for my wife because she is a makeup artist and is always looking for great lighting. After she researched several lights, she chose this product and decided to purchase it. She is happy with the light and all of the attachments. Although I should point out a few things about the packaging. I&rsquo;ve read a lot of reviews about it not coming with the stand. Well that also happened to me, SO I THOUGHT! After taking the light, bag, and lenses out, we could not find the stand! So I sent an email to the seller and they asked if I could send pictures to show what we received. I gathered all of the items and then noticed that the box was still kind of heavy. I proceeded to look in the bottom of the box and found another rectangular box (it looks like the bottom of the box) that held the stand and mount attachments! So I assume people have been throwing the box away not knowing the stand was boxed in the bottom! I advised the seller to start stating this in the description as several people have stated the same issue. It would be smart for them to at least label the box containing the stand so people will know to look. Other than that she is completely satisfied with the light.</p>

<h5 id="youtube-review-lifewithlo">YouTube review | LifewithLo</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is amazing!!! I made a YouTube UNBOXING video, it&rsquo;s up so go check it out on my channel LIFEWITHLOI will give you step by step instructions on how to put it together and how amazing this ring light is!!! Xo</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-ring-light-no-problems">Great Ring Light! No Problems!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I love this light! It was definitely worth the money, its super bright! Although it says that it is dimmable, the dimming capabilities are very slim. It is very easy to assemble, I did it without instructions and mine came with the part to also put your camera on the stand as well. I have started using this instead of another tripod because the light is great indoors. It even comes with a case to travel with to protect the ring light. Havent had it that long, so hopefully it withstands the test of time. This is a great price for what you a getting, there are other expensive ring lights out there and this really does the job. It also comes with a warm filter which I have never used but its nice to know I already have it. You basically get everthing you need to set up and you can position it really low if you wanted like 2 feet or over 6 feet if you wanted. Its worth the money!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The stand is inside the square box underneath the Neewer bag. One thing that annoying me is, the bendable stick isn&rsquo;t that steady, might works better with 14&rdquo; Ring light instead of 18&rdquo;. Overall I like it a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-this-light">I absolutely love this light</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love this light. I use it for microblading and it has improved my visability 100%. Also allows me to take amazing photos. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because if it&rsquo;s not positioned correctly it can fall over. I think the 18in light it a little too heavy for the stand if you tilt the light at all. Otherwise great product.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="yes-yes-yes">YES YES YES</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted a ring light for my videos for so long and my husband got me one and it&rsquo;s so great! It&rsquo;s dimmable (trust me, dim it or you&rsquo;ll go blind after filming a video) which is great for lots of different lighting situations, sometimes I film with JUST this light on and nothing else. I love the look it gives. The only thing bad is it&rsquo;s a LITTLE top heavy. If you adjust the base the be wider than the top (which was much larger than I thought it would be) then you should be good. Please note I also use a separate tripod for my camera so it&rsquo;s not too heavy on the light</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="product-not-as-described-at-all-disappointed-waste-of-time-and-money">Product not as described at all. Disappointed. Waste of time and money.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Save your money by actually spending a little bit more on a MUCH BETTER QUALITY product. Upon opening it for the first time, the bulb didn&rsquo;t work&ndash;flickered on, then off, then on, then half lit, then on&hellip;.This has a dimmer switch that acts like an ON/OFF switch instead. There is NO DIM.Lesson learned: spend $$$ on a better product, instead of trying to save $50 on Neewer. Now I have to spend about that much on a new bulb or twice as much on a better product.I&rsquo;m giving it 2 stars because it does turn &ldquo;on.&rdquo; But it does not live up to the product description at all. Buy at your own risk.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-light-is-great-i-like-the-fact-that-you-can-dim">The light is great. I like the fact that you can dim &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The light is great. I like the fact that you can dim it but don&rsquo;t expect a great range. The biggest gripe about this unit is the ball head. It&rsquo;s super flimsy and I wouldn&rsquo;t trust anything larger than a mirrorless camera on there. So I just a separate tripod and it&rsquo;s good to go.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-while-it-lasted">Great while it lasted</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Used this twice and either the bulb burned out or it just stopped working:(</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="buy-it-now-when-it-s-cheap">Buy it now when it&rsquo;s cheap</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great, but it kinda pisses me off that I bought it a few months ago for SIXTY DOLLARS MORE than it costs now&hellip;thanks for that&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="must-grab">MUST GRAB</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I loveeeeeee this light .. the tripod gives me a little trouble but this is most definitely a must have .. I can never do my makeup or anyone else’s without this again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It Hasn&rsquo;t Even Been 2 months yet and the tripod broke 😒😒</p>

<h5 id="incomplete-set-ruined-my-gift">Incomplete set. Ruined my gift.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The ring light works ok. I would like to rate the whole set, but unfortunately that&rsquo;s all the person I bought it for received. No filters and no stand. Just the light.</p>
