This product exceeded my expectations.Pros:-Convenient for storage in my Chrome messenger bag-iSmart dual USB ports for charging my iPad, iPhone 6 Plus, HTC mobile phone, and my PowerMonkey Extreme battery charger-Durable-Weather resistantCons:If there is an interruption of solar charging, the iPhone 6 Plus will stop charging; hence, you will have to unplug and plug it back again. This is a minor Con after my testing of the product; and, this seems to be common in all the portable solar panel charging devices I encountered.TEST RESULTS:TEST 1: Direct Sunlight Charging of Dead iPhone 6 Plus (completely on during charging): Passed.Facts:- One iPhone 6 Plus completely drained- 1 RAVPower 15W foldable solar charger- 1 OEM Apple 4 ft long lightning charging cable- San Francisco Sunny Day with no clouds and about 63 degreesTest Results:I placed the RAVPower 15W in direct sunlight; and, below, is my test results:1000 - 1030 Hours PST: 23% charge to iPhone 6 Plus1030 - 1100 Hours PST: 30% charge to iPhone 6 Plus1100 - 1130 Hours PST: 35% charge to iPhone 6 Plus1130 - 1200 Hours PST: Fullly charged iPhone 6 PlusIn about two hours, RAV Power 15W fully charged my iPhone 6 plus, under direct sunlight, without clouds, at around 63 degrees, in San Francisco, CA.TEST 2: Indoors through a Marvin window under direct sunlight charging dead iPhone 6 Plus (completely on during charging): Passed.Facts:- One iPhone 6 Plus completely drained- 1 RAVPower 15W foldable solar charger- 1 OEM Apple 4 ft long lightning charging cable- San Francisco Sunny Day with no clouds and about 63 degrees- 1 Double-pain, vacuum sealed Marvin house-window rated to prevent approximately 95% UV light spectrumTest Results:1000 - 1030 Hours PST: 17% charge to iPhone 6 Plus1030 - 1100 Hours PST: 18% charge to iPhone 6 Plus1100 - 1130 Hours PST: 20% charge to iPhone 6 Plus1130 - 1200 Hours PST: 20% charged iPhone 6 Plus1200 -1230 Hours PST: 21% charged iPhone 6 Plus1230 - 1245 Hours PST: Fully charged iPhone 6 PlusIn about two hours and forty-five minutes, RAV Power 15W fully charged my iPhone 6 plus, indoors and under direct sunlight, without clouds, at around 63 degrees, in San Francisco, CA.

<h5 id="you-will-get-a-charge-out-of-this">You will get a charge out of this!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a FINE charger for people who love the outdoors and are friendly and respectful to their environment. The solar panels and two USB charging ports are well protected by a heavy duty nylon case which fastens securely with integral Velcro strips. I tested it with two devices charging simultaneously, a Motorola Tracfone and a Creative Labs VADO Cam video camera. They both charged fine on a gray, typical, Pacific Northwest fall day*, with only occasional sun breaks. The pictures show my test setup. I also tested it with my son&rsquo;s Samsung Galaxy 3 smartphone and it charged it from 60% to 75% in about an hour on a very overcast day where the sun was only visible as a bright area in a very gray, overcast sky. The charging unit folds up to about 10&rdquo; x 7-<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&rdquo; x 1&rdquo; and would easily fit in a small day pack for taking along with you on the trails ahead. Note that it does not come with any charging cords or adapters and you would need one with a standard USB connector for your devices you plan to charge with it.*The 2 photos were taken on November 18th 2014, in my home which is about 90 miles North of Seattle Washington. The weather on this day at around 11:00am was 44 degrees and partly cloudy.</p>

<h5 id="fast-durable-waterproof-solar-charger">Fast &amp; Durable Waterproof Solar Charger</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a compact, fold-able solar charger that powers itself solely from the sun. It is very well made with heavy duty rugged nylon canvas material, Velcro straps &amp; stainless steel eye-lets. The RAVPower 16W Dual USB Solar Charger has 3 separate solar panels and it does NOT have any capacity to store. It&rsquo;s a straight to the device(s) charger (or to an external battery pack). All the power comes direct from the sun, which outputs to the dual USB ports (utilizing iSmart technology that adjusts to connected device&rsquo;s power draw) that will charge up to two USB devices simultaneously. It works in sunny and cloudy climate but is not for use in inclement rainy weather.Comes in a durable &amp; waterproof nylon fabric booklet, with four carabiner hooks, two flat Micro USB cables (one short, one standard length) and an instruction manual.I use this during my field work as a Land Surveyor where carrying external power banks are not ideal or where there are no wall sockets in sight. Output is fairly quick for a solar charger (see the screenshot of my phone while charging), but not as fast as my Quick Charge chargers which was expected. It will charge your device at it&rsquo;s fastest in direct sunlight. In cloudy days with little sun, you&rsquo;ll see a reduction in charging speed. I see the RAVPower 16W Dual USB Solar Charger ideally for use while hiking, camping, at the beach, bicycling or any fun/work environment were power isn&rsquo;t an option.One of the things I didn&rsquo;t like about this solar charger: the handy built-in compartment that stores the two USB ports, can also be used to store one phone while charging it, but I found the fit to be a bit tight (would prefer slightly larger) and would&rsquo;ve liked the location of compartment to be at the top of the solar panels (where the compartment would be facing up) and not below the solar panels (with opening facing down) when hanging the charger off of it&rsquo;s hooks. I don&rsquo;t feel comfortable in the phone staying put (see photos). The compartment is too small for tablets or thick devices. Despite this small caveat, I recommend it.READ MORE</p>
