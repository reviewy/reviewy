<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="great-value">Great Value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am new to diving so not sure how much this will help. I took this on 4 dives in Cozumel and it worked perfectly, I am a novice and I had not problem using this computer, and when I was done I was able to review the dives on the computer (depth, time, temp, etc.) I did not purchase the computer USB cable, now I wish I had. I was able to see the readouts perfectly underwater, and had my safety stop times. I would recomend this dive computer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-economical-single-or-back-up-dive-computer">Great Economical Single or Back-up Dive Computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great compact dive computer. Have tested it against my Oceanic Datamax 100 on 15 dives. The Mares Puck computer was easy to use with one botton logbook scrolling and data upate. It has a better logbook feature (keeps more dives in memory with date and time of dive along with ascent rate, coldest temperature, depth and dive length. The Oceanic Datamax read 1-2 feet deeper than the Mares Puck but other data points were the same. This is a great back-up computer and/or sport diver main computer. I really like the wrist computer for ease of reading data and reducing the among of hoses I carry.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-peasy-grab-and-go">Easy Peasy: Grab and Go!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered this dive computer for a backup at the last minute before a trip and it worked like a charm. If you want a basic computer that gives you the information you want to know, quickly - this is a great computer for you. I left the plastic screen protector that came with it on a whole trip (due to the reports that it scratches easy) and it still hasn&rsquo;t come off. Not a scratch on it. One button does it all from depth to date, time to temp.The two features I liked best about this computer were the safety stop countdown tool and the surface time counter. Safety stop feature looks like it kicks in at exactly 20 feet for the countdown. I found that really handy, even in drifts with high surge. The surface interval timer worked like a charm too and very helpful for repetitive dives. I&rsquo;ve logged 23 dives so far with it, and am very happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-accurate">Easy, accurate</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I used this for the first time in Bonaire for 15 dives. It worked great and really helped me with slower ascents (I&rsquo;ve always been a little too fast and have a hard time judging this sometimes). It documented everything as the manual says. Make sure you go through the initial set up well before your first dive. I haven&rsquo;t USB&rsquo;d it a computer to see the additional data it records, as the cable is $75 by itself! A little ridiculous IMHO. I wish the cable would come bundled with the dive computer. USB cables should not be that expensive in this day &amp; age. The face of the computer was easily visible in the water and easy to read. I loved how it would tell me how many minutes of dive time I had left at the current depth I was at. That helped me not stay too deep too long. I will definately be using this computer on my future dives and am actively recommending it to all my diving friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-basic-dive-computer">Great basic dive computer</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect for my needs. Not fancy, but does everything I need. Shows temp, depth, time, deco. Easy to read and use. Keeps my log book and is pretty durable. I&rsquo;ve had it for about 40 dives and had to replace the battery once. For this price you won&rsquo;t find any better.I dive 2-3 times a week (I live in the Caribbean) and even use nitrox sometimes and I don&rsquo;t need any more than this. Unless you&rsquo;re doing some sort of tech diving, this is perfect. It&rsquo;s VERY conservative on deco time which can be irritating, but also good for newer divers.Btw, people kept telling me the &ldquo;one button&rdquo; will irritate me, I don&rsquo;t see the issue with it. Press to scroll through and hold to select. No problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="and-glad-i-did">and glad I did</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased the Puck Mares as a backup dive computer to my Suunto Viper that is connected to my console on my regulator, and glad I did. While on my last dive, I discovered an air leak on the hose that connects to the BCD inflator hose, and had to use a spare regulator from the dive boat which had no computer on the console, only the cylinder psi reading and depth. The Suunto Viper has many more features, but the Puck Mares is easy to use with the one button function scrolling, and provides the basic information need such as non-deco time, accent rate times and warnings, along with max depth, water temp, and overall dive time. Although I did have to replace the battery when I first purchased it, after noticing a low battery indication. But after that, it functioned great on my last dive, and for the price did what is was designed to do, and happy with this purchase. It does have an optional USB cord, for download of dive data to your PC, but at an additional $75 cost, I’m ok with scrolling down to the logbook and writing it down on paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="very-worth-the-cost-great-options-and-excellent-visual-display">Very worth the cost, great options and excellent visual display.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great value for the price. I have completed two dives with this computer. The only thing I can down Maers for is the computer cable is another 80 dollars to connect this to your computer for download. I found a way to make a USB-Serial adapter though and will build this in the next week when the parts come in. Only 12 dollars verses 80&hellip;One of my dives was at night and I could not remember how to get the back light to turn on. I used my flashlight to read it though and that worked fine. I tried the back light in my bedroom afterwards and it works fine.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="inconsistent-shipping-practices-what-will-you-get">Inconsistent shipping practices, what will you get?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ordered 3 of these for an upcoming family dive trip next week. #1 shipped with a dead battery and a spare new battery in the box. #2 shipped with a working battery and reads &ldquo;BATT OK&rdquo; on the system menu. #3 shipped with no battery at all - the battery compartment was empty!The manual recommends taking the unit to a service center for battery replacement. It seems odd that <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> of the units shipped needing service. I don&rsquo;t have time to do this before our trip, so I carefully changed the batteries in the dead units. I used silicone grease to lubricate the O-rings and carefully installed the lids. I guess I won&rsquo;t know if I did it right when we make our first dive.Disappointed&hellip;..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-to-use-and-that-was-my-requirement-wear">Simple to use and that was my requirement. Wear &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Simple to use and that was my requirement. Wear it, and it tracks your dive. That&rsquo;s all I needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-computer-for-any-diver">A Great Computer For Any Diver</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read many reviews knocking this as an &ldquo;entry level&rdquo; computer or one good as a &ldquo;backup&rdquo; but it really gives the diver a lot.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Love it. Does absolutely everything I want it to do and the price is unbeatable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="dissatisfied-with-product">Dissatisfied with product!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product never worked properly and this was the second one that we ordered. The first one came in and the battery was dead.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good deal for the money</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="bad-battery-cover">Bad battery cover</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Stinks, Can&rsquo;t get the battery cover off to replace the battery. The battery cover is very soft rubber that bends when you use a coin or screwdriver to try and open it. Don&rsquo;t buy!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="three-stars">Three Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-bit-kludgy-but-works-until-it-doesn-t">A bit kludgy but works&hellip; until it doesn&rsquo;t</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>First, it came with a dead battery. Not something I would expect for a brand new item. Replacing the battery is a royal pain in the behind as the battery cap is made of soft&hellip;</p>
