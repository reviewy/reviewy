<h5 id="it-made-from-the-black-great-material-the-quality-looks-really-good">It made from the black great material, the quality looks really good</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This camcorder is really worthy to buy. It made from the black great material, the quality looks really good.This DV comes with Wide Angle Close-up Lens that help me a lot when I use this DV to take photos and a video. That is the main reason why I choose this one. Another great feature is this camcorder has dual LED lights to illuminate and its working distance is 3-5ft. That is very useful at night time. And all the other details are same as the picture on the website.I love it. It is easy to use and works well. I would like to recommend it to you.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-deal-and-price">Amazing deal and price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>An unbelievable camera. It comes with bag charging cable, av cable, lense cap, battery, wide angle close up lense (with its own bag and lense cap), lense cleaning cloth, dvd with an assortment of video and photo tools, Also, the camera has an hdmi port.At first, I could not figure out how to record video or take photos of something close up. Anything viewed real close up was very blurry. The extra wide-angle-close-up lens is a two-piece unit. For wide angle use, leave the two pieces screwed together. To use just the close-up / macro portion, unscrew the two sections. Then, screw the smaller portion onto the camera lense - and even tiny print viewed close up will be clear!</p>

<h5 id="this-is-a-great-value-camera">This is a great value camera</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great value camera. Takes really crisp images and the zoom is amazing. Also has excellent image stability control so images are not blurred even in hand held high zoom situations. Battery life is pretty decent. I do not have any sound or zoom issue so far fortunately and hope it will last a while!Good for family!Easy to use!</p>

<p> I am so happy with this camera! It is so fun documenting things we are doing in our new home. It takes really good videos. I love the size and I love all of the functions that it has. I like how easy it is to use and the reversible screen. We have used it so much around the house and on vacation it&rsquo;s great!</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Works great. Bought at my father in laws request, so he can videotape his grandkids track and field games, football games,etc (and then make us watch them..even though we were there&hellip;) (My daughter is &lsquo;modeling&rsquo; it in the photos) Easy to operate, very clear, he has no problems operating and he&rsquo;s not tech savvy! I have one just like this, but I didn&rsquo;t want to loan it out..so we bought this one! 5 stars!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="simple-to-use-good-quality-camcorder">Simple to use, good quality camcorder</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> I am not very tech savvy, so it normally takes me awhile to learn how to use any new electronics we purchase. But this camera is so easy to use, I was recording and taking pictures right after we opened it. It does require that you purchase a SD card , but it comes with everything else I would ever need to take wonderful pictures and videos. I did not have the volume up when I was recording so my Jeff&rsquo;s voice is not loud enough on the video, but the beautiful colors show well and it is not grainy at all. I absolutely recommend this camera.</p>
