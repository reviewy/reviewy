<h5 id="works-with-rpi2-motionpie-and-blue-iris">Works with RPI2, MotionPie, and Blue Iris</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works great with the MotionPie software. The IRs do get a little warm however not too hot to touch. I installed a 2.1mm lens, which it accepts the standard size that you can by here or eBay for about 9 dollars. I am looking to find a way to compress the stream with H264 to lower the bitrate to get higher resolution at more FPS which the RPI2 should be able to handle. The max settings with MotionPie over wifi results in 1600X1200 100% Quality, and yields 2.5FPS, 2500kB/s, and the settings I use are 1280X1024 75% Quality, and it yields 11FPS, 1000kB/s. I attach a picture with my setting so you can see for yourself. This setup looks better that my Foscam 9803P however without the H264 compression the bitrate is much higher. Overall I would rather build a camera than buy it. It is a pretty fun and easy project. Comment if you have questions. Thanks.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="does-what-it-s-suppose-to-do">Does what it&rsquo;s suppose to do</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works more or less as you&rsquo;d expect it to. I can see my office pretty darn well with the lights off at night through this thing, so it works for night vision pretty darn well. Colors are a bit muddy, but that is pretty much par for the course with most low light cameras I think. All things considered for my application I&rsquo;d rather have good night vision than crisp daytime colors anyway. The big side mount IR LEDs mean it won&rsquo;t fit in a standard Pi camera housing (not that there are many to start with).The big LEDs on the side do glow faintly red, probably not quite as bright as the average status LCD on your DVD player. I&rsquo;m assuming they are pretty bright in the IR spectrum, but obviously can&rsquo;t see that.I&rsquo;m building a chicken coop monitor &amp; automation system (open/close doors to let them out after we leave in the morning &amp; at dusk, measure water/food level, etc.) &amp; this should be pretty much what we are looking for to keep an eye on them at any hour without trudging out to the coop. I&rsquo;d buy another one if/when I have another low light webcam project involving a Pi again.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="nice-camera-led-module-with-a-few-caveats">Nice camera / LED module with a few caveats&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does good with a few caveats&hellip;Focus is critical. Spent some time getting it focused. It seems to go from blurry to more or less in focus in about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> turn of the lens. On mine, it was quite far out and the lens is a little loose at that point. Going to try a wrap or two of the teflon plumbers tape to see if I can tighten it up, otherwise I expect it will move.It does color, but seems very washed out in daylight, may be camera settings, don&rsquo;t know yet and we will see how it does in the dark.Mounting is a challenge :-). Found a mount on Thingverse for these things and printed it, would be nice if there was a case for the camera, Pi and the PIR module, but you are on your own to solve the challenge.Will update this once I get to try it in the dark. Going to have to fake it initially since the PIR module seems to have died.All that said, it is a nice unit for the purpose intended.This one: Waveshare Raspberry Pi Camera Night Vision Camera Module 5MP OV5647 Webcam Video 1080p for Any Version of Raspberry-piREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="the-included-ir-leds-are-just-about-useless-the-light-they-produce-will-only-make-things">The included IR LEDs are just about useless. The light they produce will only make things &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The included IR LEDs are just about useless. The light they produce will only make things about 3-4 inches away from the camera visible in pitch black conditions. The camera is fine, and does everything you&rsquo;d expect a regular Raspberri Pi camera to do, but since that&rsquo;s not why you&rsquo;re ordering this specific item I can&rsquo;t give it higher than 2 stars.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="bought-this-in-march-and-haven-t-gotten-it-to-work">Bought this in March and haven&rsquo;t gotten it to work &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought this in March and haven&rsquo;t gotten it to work with my raspberry pi 3. It didn&rsquo;t have a lot of reviews back then and I thought it was me not setting it up correctly. However, I can see the power light come on when you run raspistill -v -o image.jpg but continually gets an error. Wish I had returned it right away now it&rsquo;s just junk. Avoid!READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="doesn-t-work-out-of-the-box">Doesn&rsquo;t work out of the box</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Camera doesn&rsquo;t work at all. It doesn&rsquo;t even try. I have tried it on a pi 2 and a p3. I have other camera&rsquo;s and they work. I have done some research, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like it needs any special drivers. If I unplug this camera and plug in one of my other ones those work fine. When I plug this camera in, and try and take a picture it errors with &ldquo;Camera is not detected.&rdquo; Out of all of the accessories and Pi&rsquo;s I have bought, this is the only thing I have purchased that has not worked. It is a bummer because it is pretty nice looking. I think I have messed around with it longer than I could return it trying to get it to work. I have a Waveshare Monitor that works flawlessly, but this little camera is not good.Here is what I have doneI have enabled the camera &ndash; of course because other camera&rsquo;s work.I have tried different Pi&rsquo;s with different power suppliesI have changed the ribbons, and used the ribbon that came with this camera with another camera and that camera works.I feel I have eliminated everything leading to the camera not working.If the manufacture reads this and makes arrangements to swap the camera, I will change my rating, but it seems like others are having the same issues, so I would probably stay away from this product. Unless you have time to test it, and figure out what is wrong with it in the time allotted to send it back if it doesn&rsquo;t work. Or if it doesn&rsquo;t work don&rsquo;t spend any time with it, just send it back right away.From now on if it doesn&rsquo;t work, I will just send it back right away other than trying to figure out why it doesn&rsquo;t work.From what I gather all you have to do to get this to work is plug the ribbon in (making sure it is the right orientation), update the OS, make sure the camera is enabled (raspi-config) reboot, and type raspistill -o cam.jpg in the terminal, and it should take a picture. At least that is how all of my other cameras work. If you do that, and it doesn&rsquo;t work, package it back up and send it back. Don&rsquo;t waste any more time on it like I did.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="night-vision-adjustable-focus-picam-good">night vision, adjustable focus, picam. good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>NOIR cam, with low light triggered photodiodes. it&rsquo;s hard to find a fault here aside from the form factor being fatter than the picam with the floods attached. alternate camera mount designs are on thingiverse or other 3d printing sites to accomodate the dimensions. wide angle lens with adjustable focus also wins my return business.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="night-vision-is-great-good-value">Night vision is great. Good value</h5>

<p>I used it on my Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. Night vision is great. Good value. I do hope that the cable could be a little bit longer.</p>

<h5 id="third-party-woes-nothing-insurmountable">Third Party Woes, Nothing Insurmountable</h5>

<p>Gets hot, needs more power than the PI can provide. Had to take the LED&rsquo;s off or add more voltage to the Pi.Other than that, it works as expected.</p>

<p>IR lamps are attached with tiny and hard to tighten screws, which can easily come undone by themselves. Power hungry; works fine with (but creates dependency on) 2.</p>
