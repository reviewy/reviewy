<h5 id="very-well-built-but">Very well built, but&hellip;.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I like how light weight is it and that you&rsquo;re able to trust that which ever position you leave in will stay. It also has many different positions you can use depending on what kind of shot you want. On the downside, the handle is very small which makes it awkward to hold. The gopro attachment is on the side not on the end which when you have your gopro on it, it tends to give weight to one side and with the slim handle it feels uncomfortable when using in the extended position. But other than that, very well built.</p>

<h5 id="this-3-way-pole-is-great-it-is-made-of-lightweight-aluminum">This 3-way pole is great. It is made of lightweight aluminum</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This 3-way pole is great. It is made of lightweight aluminum. It is very sturdy. It has no wobble. The joints lock down tight and secure. It is an extremely stable platform for not only the GoPro but for almost any camera.I tried the GoPro brand 3-way pole and an inexpensive knock off. Both were made of plastic. While they were sturdy there was still a lot of wobble and wiggle.The SmaPole is the 3-way pole you should have if you use a GoPro.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome">AWESOME!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great GoPro wand. I&rsquo;m very impressed with the quality. Every single piece of this thing is aluminum and the build is excellent. It&rsquo;s compact (when folded), lightweight, and easily fits in pockets. I really like that you can pose the arm in so many different configurations depending on the shot you&rsquo;re trying to get. Whether using it for selfie shots or filming your masterpiece, this stick is awesome! I highly recommend!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-is-nice-to-find-a-company">it is nice to find a company</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Given the way that GoPro spanks you hard for every little item, it is nice to find a company, Smatree, that provides quality built products for a reasonable price. Easily as well made us any of the GoPro items, which are admittedly very well made, thier products come at a reasonable price, are equally well-made and sometimes better engineered. This cannot be said of all off-brand, secondary market GoPro compatible products. This item. To a very compact size, making it perfect for adventure sports. We can be carried along anywhere.</p>

<h5 id="compatible-with-akaso-ek7000-and-perfect-for-vegas-trip">Compatible with Akaso EK7000 and perfect for Vegas Trip</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just bought this to use with AKASO EK7000 4K WIFI Sports Action Camera Ultra HD Waterproof DV Camcorder 12MP 170 Degree Wide Angle. So far have only used it inside the house and outside. It does improve the steadiness of the camera when taking shots. The pole itself is well made and good quality. It seems durable and extremely compact. We will be taking it to Vegas this weekend and hope to get full usage out of it. Very happy with this purchase.</p>

<h5 id="robust-gopro-pole-in-a-compact-package">Robust GoPro Pole in a Compact Package</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My normal go-to GoPro pole/stick is the Quik Pod Ultra. But I&rsquo;ve had great experiences with many Smatree products in the past so I figured I&rsquo;d give this one a shot.Love:1. The aluminum construction. I take it diving regularly in salt water and it holds up well. It also just feels really solid in the hand and doesn&rsquo;t jiggle or rattle in any way. I have no concerns about it falling apart any time soon.2. It comes with an aluminum tripod mount and thumbscrew, both of which are superior to the plastic alternatives.3. It collapses down to a relatively small package. This is great for putting in a bag or case, and something I can&rsquo;t really do with my Quik Pod.4. The action of the screws to adjust the position of the sections is smooth and they are easy to turn.Don&rsquo;t Love:1. Unfolding it takes some time. This is a trade-off you have to make for how robust the joints are and how small you can fold it down to, and in my opinion it&rsquo;s worth it. However it is a con for many people.2. It&rsquo;s just a little too short for me. This is nit-picky, but I like to have just a little more length for my GoPro poles. However, this one can also collapse to a much smaller size than most of the others, so again it&rsquo;s a trade-off.All-in-all, it&rsquo;s a great GoPro pole/stick that won&rsquo;t fail on you.Disclosure: I was given a discount on this product in exchange for this review. However, I was asked to review the product honestly and with years of professional experience using GoPro cameras I did my best to not let this discount color the review. This is my honest assessment of the product.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-an-awesome-gopro-pole">This is an awesome GoPro pole</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is an awesome GoPro pole. The various lengths/positions it adjusts to make it very useful and versatile. It would be cool if they figured out a way to make the sections adjust without the screwing mechanisms, but that could potentially jeopardize the sturdiness of the pole..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-but-what-some-of-the-bits-are-for-is-unclear-and-support-is-absent">Works, but what some of the bits are for is unclear and support is absent.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>So far working GREAT. Mounting its base to my tripod, and configuring this to lean the Hero camera out, its the perfect level to film table-top/benchwork/over the shoulder stuff while I&rsquo;m sitting.Support is questionable though - the website has no clear indication about what the rubber o-ring in the kit is for, nor what do you do with that round end-bolt. A question emailed to the makers via their website has resulted in no response. A simple diagram of &ldquo;here is whats in the kit&rdquo; and what they are for - would be all thats needed.</p>

<h5 id="a-gift-well-appreciated">A gift well appreciated</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Arrived earlier than expected. Haven’t used it since it was a gift, but I’m told it works great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cool-looking">Cool looking</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pretty cool and useful, great look and I hope it is flexible enough on my next trip to be worth its price.</p>

<h5 id="ok">Ok</h5>

<p>Not very practical with all the tightening and I tightening but it did it’s job</p>

<h5 id="thumbs-screws-stripped-out-on-first-day">Thumbs Screws stripped out on first day</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Feels solid at first but then thumb screws strip out when you tighten then down. I have tried to super glue them to them to stay put but no good.</p>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very nice</h5>

<p>Good shipping and the quality is excellent, well built and nice appearance. I want to apply a coating to the handle for better grip.</p>
