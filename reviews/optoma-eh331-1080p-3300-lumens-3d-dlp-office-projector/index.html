<h5 id="awesome-for-the-price">Awesome for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this for use on my back deck which has a covered pergola. For the price this thing is awesome! I bought the projector, a 100in screen and an amazon sound bar for less than I could get a large flatscreen tv for. In the daytime the picture is a little faint but you can still see it as long as your screen is shaded. No problem in the evening while the sun is still out but starting to go down. I bought this one because it has an audio out which makes it nice because I ran a 3.5 cable from the out on the projector to the sound bars 3.5 aux in. No issues with sound. I plugged an amazon fire stick right into the back of the hdmi port on the projector and I use DIRECTVNOW to stream tv through my internet with no satellite required. Hope this helps answer some questions about functionality. Be careful to select the language of your choice upon setup because it took me forever to find out how to switch it back to english.</p>

<h5 id="ok-wow">Ok, Wow</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Nicely packaged, came with carrying case. Connected Laptop with VGA cable provided and PS3 with HDMI cable I had on hand. Placed approx 12-13 Ft from wall provided 96&rdquo; Viewing area with very clear picture on wall, can&rsquo;t wait to see what this looks like on a screen. I connected my computer speakers for increased sound which worked fine for the first go round; will purchase better speakers soon. All in all I am very satisfied and look forward to setting up a spare bedroom as a movie room.</p>

<h5 id="great-projector-for-all-types-of-video">Great projector for all types of video!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector works very well and is very bright!!! There are many options and features to make this projector fit almost any need you have. For the price, this is a great projector option.We first purchased a 720p native projector to use for viewing sports outside. Since all the sports channels we use it for broadcast in 720p we really didn&rsquo;t need a 1080p projector. However, we found ourselves using the projector in our living room more and more to the point it became our every day display. At that point we decided that we might like the additional resolution of a 1080p native projector. This has been a great purchase! The picture quality is very good. The colors and brightness are great! The 3D is amazing!The fan noise is about typical. Since the projector is mounted on the ceiling above our couch, we can hear the fan if we pay attention to it but it is quiet enough that it is very easy to block out the noise.I do wish that the projector could process changes faster than it does. Turning on the 3D feature has a bit more of a delay than our other projectors. However, these delays are not a big deal.Our living room is on a side of the house that gets hit with direct sunlight all day long. We can use this projector with the curtains open on a sunny day with surprisingly little wash out. It is bright enough that watching is during the day with curtains open is not an issue.Sure there are projectors with more features and better options but at this price, this projector offers everything I would expect and more.We use the projector for everyday TV viewing. It is used for Sports almost every day and movies at least 4 times a week. This projector handles still and high motion video very well.</p>

<h5 id="perfect-for-what-we-need">Perfect for what we need</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>PERFECT for what we needed! Worked as expected and love the price. We are using this in a somewhat small church sanctuary and it is more than enough to handle song slides, announcements, and missionary slideshows\videos.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="awesome-projector-dont-miss-out">Awesome projector dont miss out</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical about this at first all the reviews didn&rsquo;t mention if it would show 1080p but the x341 xga model does just that I&rsquo;m not sure about the svga one.. I was blown away by the way my ps4 looks on it the only concern I have is the ratio kinda gets on my nerves it&rsquo;s native 4:3 so when playing 16:9 ratio on ps4 or firestick it shows grey bars around the picture kinda frustrating but when it&rsquo;s super dark didn&rsquo;t notice it so bad I will upload photos soon. the xga model or better I would definitely recommend to anyone. don&rsquo;t let the 16:9 issue keep you from a awesome projector I started on a 1200 lumen simple beam gp70(( still love the fact it does a way bigger picture from 10ft and true 16:9 so will keep it for backup)) but anyways back to the main topic the 3300 lumens and color depth of this projector is just astounding its equal or maybe better then my 55 inch 4k phillips tv ..</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-especially-for-the-price">Great especially for the price!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This projector has a really bright and colorful picture. We also owned a Epson EX3220 3 LCD which cost us about 500 after taxes the picture was more dull and about half as bright. We plan on buying another. Only can is no auto keystone but I end up manually adjusting anyways.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-for-all-computers">Not for all computers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good but not great projector. Never really got the fuzziness on screen to go away. May have been due to high end tablets and laptops being used. Also when a surface pro was connected the font was unreadable, we connected the same surface pro to another projector and the font was fine.Amazon was fantastic on the return of a mistakingly double order on this item.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am a mobile Dj so I offer movie nights with this projector and the inflatable screen the big 12 ft one it does awesome here is a pic of the screen and the movie I played last night. I am very pleased I am probally going to get a bigger projector in the following months for bigger events.</p>

<h5 id="of-you-have-time-to-spare">Of you have time to spare.</h5>

<p>Purchased from Amazon Warehouse, it did not work Amazon was able to make it better, but it took a couple of hours on the phone or the next three days.</p>

<h5 id="cheapest-name-brand-i-found-excellent-for-the-price">Cheapest name brand I found. Excellent for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Looks good with lots of options under settings to adjust for your viewing. The 3D option didn&rsquo;t work so well ( do I need a 3D screen? ).</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-working">Not working</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This has never worked. I just found out because it was a gift to a school program. They have had techs try and used different cables but the projector doesn&rsquo;t recognize any&hellip;</p>
