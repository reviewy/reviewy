Product Description
Designed to work with multiple Sonicare models, proresults snap-on replacement brush heads feature a surface area designed for hard to reach spaces and radial-trimmed, contoured bristles to thoroughly clean and massage teeth and gums.</p>

<p>From the Manufacturer
Maintaining good oral health is easy with the Philips Sonicare ProResults Compact toothbrush head. Designed to work with multiple Sonicare models, these snap-on replacement brush heads are compact to help you reach tight places. They feature radial-trimmed, contoured bristles to thoroughly clean and massage teeth and gums. The blue reminder bristles fade to let you know when it&rsquo;s time for replacement. Replace your brush head every three months for best results.</p>

<p>ProResults snap-on replacement brush heads are compact to help you reach tight places. View larger.</p>

<p>Compact Brush Head for Hard-to-Reach Areas
The ProResults Compact toothbrush heads helps you easily maneuver your brush to focus on hard-to-reach areas where plaque and stains can hide. A contoured bristle design on the smaller surface area cleans as thoroughly as other Sonicare brush heads, while allowing you to focus on problem areas.</p>

<p>Angled Bristles Cover Larger Surface Area
The curved surface area created by the brush head&rsquo;s angled, radial-trimmed bristles helps you maintain contact with the surfaces of the teeth and gums as the brush head pivots, covering a large surface area as effectively as a standard brush head.</p>

<p>The bristles&rsquo; contoured pattern fits the natural shape of your teeth. Peaks and valleys along the length of the brush head are ergonomically designed to fit between teeth so you&rsquo;re less likely to miss places when you brush. This means ProResults brush heads remove more disease-causing plaque than a manual toothbrush for a healthier mouth.</p>

<p>Replace Every Three Months
You can&rsquo;t see it, but your brush head wears over time. Blue reminder bristles fade in color to let you know when it&rsquo;s time to replace the brush head. Dental professionals recommend replacing your brush head every three months. Sonicare technology helps you remove up more plaque than a manual toothbrush.</p>

<p>Fits Multiple Sonicare Handles
The ProResults Compact brush head works with the following Sonicare models: DiamondClean, FlexCare+, FlexCare , HealthyWhite, and EasyClean.</p>

<p>The heads easily snap onto handles and come with caps for hygienic storage and travel.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the Box
Three ProResults Compact sonic toothbrush heads and three travel caps.</p>

<h5 id="counterfeit-consumers-beware">COUNTERFEIT! Consumers beware!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>COUNTERFEIT! Consumers beware!I purchased this item from Aroma Beauty (July 21st, 2014) and it took me a while to realize it was counterfeit.Here&rsquo;s is how you can tell if you have a counterfeit:1. The metal ring inside at the base will corrode2. It doesn&rsquo;t snap on/off as easily3. The color of white doesn&rsquo;t match the toothbrush base4. The ProResults logo is stretched out some5. The toothbrush &ldquo;lasts&rdquo; a long time. That is to say that the blue indicator bristles don&rsquo;t fade away.You should take great concern if your brushes are fake. My dentist noticed gum decay from the brush being too hard. I was wondering why this would be since I haven&rsquo;t been brushing any harder. This is just one thing that could be affecting you. We do not know what chemicals the counterfeit manufacturers are using and if they may be harmful to your health.Take action! Call Philips Sonicare Support at 1-800-682-7664 and let them know.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-crap-knock-offs-that-don-t-completely-fit">They are crap knock-offs that don&rsquo;t completely fit</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a FRAUD. These are NOT real Philips heads. They are crap knock-offs that don&rsquo;t completely fit, and have &ldquo;Philips&rdquo; printed on the side in blurry black ink. They work like they were made by two high-school students in Lagos. WARNING! DO NOT BE FRAUDED LIKE I WAS.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="fake">FAKE!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>NOT advertised! No resenblance to the image in Amazon offering. Cheap, sparse bristles. Clearly knock offs. I used one of them before I realized I&rsquo;d been ripped off, so I&rsquo;m stuck with them. Never again. Paid premium price when I could have got the same poor quality for half the cost with an honestly-presented generic. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Attaching a photo of the old REAL Sonicare brush head next to the new knockoff.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="expensive-and-wears-out-quicker">Expensive and wears out quicker</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Still a great toothbrush but compared to the older version these heads seem to wear out much faster. Way too much money for what you get.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-replace-these-every-3-months-as-recommended-by-my-hygienist">I replace these every 3 months as recommended by my hygienist</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I replace these every 3 months as recommended by my hygienist. Works very well. Gets in the smaller areas the standard size cannot get to. Price is most reasonable on Amazon most of the time.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality-refills">Good quality refills</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These brush heads are a big improvement over the older E series designed heads which had spaces that got very dirty very easily. This design eliminates that problem.My biggest complaint is what you pay for which is for all intent and purpose are essentially 3 mini toothbrushes.I am a big fan of sonicare toothbrushes which do a good job at cleaning your teeth but they seriously need to charge less for the refills of the toothbrush products which is typically in the 20 to 30 dollar range.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="exactly-what-i-needed">exactly what i needed</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered these to fit my sonicare toothbrush and it&rsquo;s just what i needed! Everything is as described at prompt shipping. i wish it was a little easier to open the package so that i could keep the brush heads in them and put them away but the way i had to open it, i ended up having to put them in a ziplock or something. I like that it also comes with the color rings so you can tell different brush heads apart. i lost that pack on my last box so i was pleased to get new ones! Overall works great and the compact size makes it good for travel.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="too-big">Too Big</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought these replacement heads for my HX6511/50 EasyClean Sonicare because the description said it fits all EasyClean&rsquo;s. I may be doing something wrong (although it seems simple enough to just slip the replacement head onto the toothbrush handle) but the replacement head is a little lose so if I am not holding it with my finger at the base while brushing my teeth, it will fall off from the vibrations&hellip; Super annoying! Or if I pick up the toothbrush by the stem of the brush head it will slip right off the toothbrush (the brush head that came with the toothbrush was snug enough that it would not come off that easily). I&rsquo;m going to try the HX6013&rsquo;s but I&rsquo;m worried i&rsquo;m going to get the same results. I&rsquo;ll post an update when I try the others.UPDATE: I tried the Philips Sonicare HX6013 ProResults Brush Head Standard and I am happy to report that these fit the HX6511/50 :)</p>

<h5 id="ouch-brush-is-much-to-hard">Ouch! Brush is much to hard.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ouch! I tried these smaller brushes and they are way too hard. Stay with the normal &ldquo;medium&rdquo; brushes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-value">Good value</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It is strong and good quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-compact-heads-work-best-for-me-because-they-reach-my-wisdom-teeth">These compact heads work best for me because they reach my wisdom teeth</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These compact heads work best for me because they reach my wisdom teeth. I get good remarks from the dentist each time I go for an exam/cleaning.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>love this size the best - toothpaste does not splatter all over as you are brushing</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="these-are-much-better">These are much better.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Actual brand name brushes. I&rsquo;ve had cheap imitations before. These are much better.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-for-me">Works for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The only way I can find the compact size. With Prine this is very convenient.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>well made product these last longer than generic</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-2">Five Stars</h5>

<p>They fit the toothbrush and work well. I like the smaller size.</p>
