<h5 id="excellent-read-and-write-performance-in-a-value-microsd-card">Excellent read and write performance in a value microSD card</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I tested the 32GB version of the PNY Elite-X microSD card. The card offers U3 speed rating (meaning it can sustain at least 30MB/s continuous write speed). The card is rated 90MB/s read speed and no write speed is advertised other than the U3 rating. I tested the card in several USB 3.0 card readers and it benchmarked between 75-77 MB/s sequential write in all of them. Compared with the regular Elite card this one has over twice as fast write speed and is excellent performance for the price (when purchased it was similar in price to the Elite card).&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3 x64 &copy; 2007-2013 hiyohiyoCrystal Dew World : <a href="http://crystalmark.info/-----------------------------------------------------------------------*">http://crystalmark.info/-----------------------------------------------------------------------*</a> MB/s = 1,000,000 byte/s [SATA/300 = 300,000,000 byte/s]Sequential Read : 96.661 MB/sSequential Write : 76.954 MB/sRandom Read 512KB : 89.226 MB/sRandom Write 512KB : 21.220 MB/sRandom Read 4KB (QD=1) : 5.988 MB/s [ 1461.8 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=1) : 0.918 MB/s [ 224.1 IOPS]Random Read 4KB (QD=32) : 7.517 MB/s [ 1835.1 IOPS]Random Write 4KB (QD=32) : 0.780 MB/s [ 190.5 IOPS]Test : 1000 MB <a href="x5">F: 0.0% (0.0/30.2 GB)</a>Date : 2016/06/29 13:54:24OS : Windows 8.1 Pro <a href="x64">6.3 Build 9600</a></p>

<h5 id="works-with-android-6-0-adoptable-storage-feature">Works with Android 6.0 Adoptable Storage Feature!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I recently purchase a new Moto G4 Plus from Motorola to replace a phone which took a dip in the ocean. My new phone is great, with the only major drawback being that it only has 16 GB onboard storage. Enter in Android 6.0&rsquo;s new adoptable internal memory feature, and this microSD card. I tried two cards before purchasing this one, a 32 B and 64 GB card both of which guaranteed hi-speed performance (both were Class 10 UHS-1). However, when I tried using them as added internal storage on my phone, they both tested rates of read/write which were too slow to be useful (causes app stuttering if data is moved to the card), and were essentially useless to me.This card, however, had no problem keeping up with the data transfer speed requirements of the phone, and has added 32 GB to the storage of my phone seamlessly. If you are in the market to expand your phone&rsquo;s native storage, I can&rsquo;t recommend any other card or brand higher than this. PNY has consistently delivered good products and great customer service, and they&rsquo;re pretty unbeatable for the the price point.</p>

<h5 id="it-works-well-however-the-effective-write">It works well. However, the effective write / &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It works well.However, the effective write / file copy speed is quite slow (&lt; 4-8 Mb/sec) in my setup: windows laptop Harddisk to the PNY microSD card using the bundled SDcard adapter via the laptop&rsquo;s built-in SD card slot.I am NOT saying that the card itself is slow. It might be slowed down by any other parts of my setup.Instead, the effective speed could be drastically slower than what you might hope for, depending on your setup.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="significantly-faster-than-the-samsung-mb-mp64da-am">Significantly faster than the Samsung MB-MP64DA/AM</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This 64GB card is significantly faster than the MB-MP64DA/AM from Samsung. I got 45 MB/s reads and 25 MB/s writes on that card. With this I am getting 86 MB/s reads and 83 MB/s writes. That is significantly faster and it&rsquo;s only $7 more, so I would definitely get this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="if-you-use-batteries-fast-this-might-fix-that">If you use batteries fast - this might fix that!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My best camera would eat batteries in a heart beat when I used a U1 sim chip - after buying a faster chip, the camera didn&rsquo;t work hard at all to save videos anymore - fixed my only complaint about the camera. I guess they could have said to use the U3 in the instructions!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-perfectly">Works perfectly</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is great&ndash;I bought this to use in my (New) Nintendo 3DS XL. It was easy to transfer my save data from my original micro sd card that came with my (new) 3DS XL to this one and it worked perfectly after I inserted it into my (new) 3DS XL. No issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-is-the-card-to-get-for-expanding-android-storage">This is the card to get for expanding android storage!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Thanks to this card I was able to expand my android storage on my Motorola Pure and I think it&rsquo;s actually gotten faster since doing that. I tried with other cards but could not get it to work or would notice lag in apps and especially the camera app. Not with this card. It&rsquo;s blazing fast and probably faster than the built in storage.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-identify-as-uhs-1">Not identify as UHS-1</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Moto G4 says, This SD card appears to be slow, when i try to use it as extended internal storage. Which mean my phone do not identify it as UHS-1 type, even though it is advertised as UHS-1</p>

<p>DO NOT BUY THIS. I lost an entire commercial shoot due to this card not meeting proper specs. This is NOT a U3 XC1 performance card.</p>
