<h5 id="the-wontechmi-camping-lantern-should-be-considered-a-everyday-kit">The Wontechmi Camping lantern should be considered a everyday kit &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The Wontechmi Camping lantern should be considered a everyday kit essential. This is not just a Lantern but an emergency devicea Quick Click of the power button will show the amount of charge on the lantern. Besides illuminating dark places from a small led device the magnet fixes to the inside of a car hood. the Clip can connect to your belt top to have it with you in any event or in a tent.Having the the unit with you will allow you to shine light or keep a mobile device charged in case of emergencies.My only problem is that it says camping lantern when it is an all around emergency back up device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great">Great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> It is perfect for outdoor activities, whether used for Field survival, camping, hiking, and emergency. I love the power pack indicator lights that show how much juice you have left. The input charging port and output port are sealed well. It&rsquo;s also super convenient to clip it to something.Overall, I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for emergency or outdoor light that lasts a long time plus the powerbank capability.</p>

<h5 id="i-am-very-pleased-with-this-little-tent-light">I am very pleased with this little tent light.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am very pleased with this little tent light. Surprisingly bright, very portable light, with a long battery life. We typically hang this outside, over our picnic table. It let&rsquo;s us play games at night in the summer. It may seem small, but it&rsquo;s bright enough to let everyone see very clearly. The built-in magnet is incredibly useful. It&rsquo;s allowed me to attach this to a metal pole outside, so it can act as a grill light. It&rsquo;s also helped with automotive work. It&rsquo;s also rechargeable so during a crisis situation all you need is a power point in a vehicle to recharge. This little light has come in handy in so many circumstances. Love it.</p>

<h5 id="amazing-lantern-amazing-price">Amazing Lantern! Amazing Price!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Its not very often you come across a neat device such as the WONTECHMI camping lantern! With a 5200mah battery you can either use this device for several hours of lamp time or you can use it as a battery pack and charge your devices either way it is a win win! The magnets built into the top of the top of the lantern makes it a wonderful addition to a tool box as well you can use it for the garage if you needed to simply stick it to the hood of the car and you are good to go! I give this Product a clear <sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>!</p>

<h5 id="to-other-amazon-potential-customer-s-it-work-s-as-designed">To, other Amazon potential customer&rsquo;s. It work&rsquo;s as designed.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I reviewed the product &amp; other customer comments. I rated the Wontechmi Camping Lantern with 5 Stars because i liked it. And i ordered 2 of them &amp; received 2 of them. I thought the Lanterns Led service life was excellent &amp; the capacity of the built in. Rechargeable built-in battery was excellent also. I found the operating switch easy-to-use also. Basically i consider it a excellent device &amp; easy to charge to full battery power. I plan to use my lanterns around my residence. And when i need a handy tool. And when i travel some where at night. Like when i go grocery shopping at the local market at night. And i also can charge my Lanterns with USB Car power when necessary. In closing, i recommend them. Thank you &mdash; G.O.</p>

<h5 id="great-light-for-camping-or-any-other-use">Great Light for camping or any other use</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I cannot believe how bright this light is and it&rsquo;s ability to be able to charge basically any hand held device. The light has multiple settings for whatever situation or place it is in. It has a magnetic side to it so it can cling to different surfaces like the side of a car or wall for any purpose.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-one-of-the-best-purchases-i-ve-ever-made-it-helped-a-lot">This is one of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve ever made - it helped a lot &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is one of the best purchases I&rsquo;ve ever made - it helped a lot on my recent camping trip - I love that it&rsquo;s waterproof, you can clip it or hang it from anywhere and it weighs almost NOTHING - I didn&rsquo;t need a big lantern or any other light source.</p>
