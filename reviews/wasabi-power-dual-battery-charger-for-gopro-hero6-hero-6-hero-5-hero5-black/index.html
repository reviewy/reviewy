<h5 id="great-value-for-quality-batteries">Great value for quality batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Wasabi batteries for a lot of my cameras, lights and other devices for years in my career as a professional Director of Photography. At first I was skeptical that they&rsquo;d work properly or give me the same lifespan as OEM batteries, but it&rsquo;s been my experience that they&rsquo;ve performed at or above the level of OEM batteries whether GoPro&rsquo;s or Sony&rsquo;s. I just upgraded to Hero 5 cameras from the 4&rsquo;s and bought two OEM batts and a 2 pack plus charger from Wasabi. I love their two slot charger and USB cord, it works fast to help me recharge after a day of shooting. I also like that it doesn&rsquo;t matter which charger or battery I&rsquo;m using, all will charge in either the GoPro or the Wasabi charger, or I can charge them in camera.I&rsquo;m also using their NP F975 batteries for various LED panels and lights that I work with, and they&rsquo;re as good or better than original too.The wasabi hero 5 batteries are working fine with the latest GoPro firmware, no problems at all with fit or performance.I highly recommend them unless you really feel compelled to pay twice the price to have the GoPro or Sony name on your batteries!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-batteries-bad-hub">Good batteries, bad hub&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m still very new to using my GoPro Hero5 Black but already can see that the camera goes through the battery very quickly. That is why I decided to look for another battery back to be able to extend my GoPro&rsquo;s life while out shooting video. Looking around at comments and feedback from other Amazon reviews, it seemed like the Wasabi V03 battery packs were the best choice in price, extended battery life over the GoPro versions and their comparability with the firmware updates.All of that is top notch and gets 5 stars. The issue I have and why I&rsquo;ve taken away 2 stars is that the charging hub and the cable to plug into the USB are cheaply made and I can see that I will need to soon either get a replacement hub or find another brand when this one breaks.When I first plugged in the hub to power all 3 lights came on &ldquo;green&rdquo;. Then I plugged in the first wasabi battery and that light turned red(showing that it was charging, while the other 2 lights stayed green while no battery packs were in them. I then plugged in the 2nd wasabi battery pack and that light turned red but the 3rd light diminished. I jiggled the battery in the slot and the light flickered green and red but did not stay on green. This is a sign to me that the electronics inside the hub have loose connections and will eventually Break off the board and become unusable to a non-electronics technician.The prong cord to plug in the power is flimsy and can be easily bent causing it to become unusable. Wasabi supplies another cord which had two plugs into the port very awkwardly and seems like it&rsquo;s going to break inside the hub.So for that, 3 stars&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="not-suitable-for-hero-5-go-pro-software-changes-can-leave-you-with-no-working-battery">Not suitable for Hero 5, Go Pro software changes can leave you with no working battery!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>On a Hero 5 black, the batteries lasted 20 minutes. The battery remaining percentage shown on the Hero 5 screen showed 100% dropped to 80% in 10 minutes and 5% by 20 minutes of recording. Oddly enough, shutting off the Hero 5 power and restarting reset the battery meter to 80% again. The battery quickly discharged in 10 minutes. I fully recharged the batteries and tried again. The camera ran longer this time but less than half the original battery. The sudden drop in battery meter readings occurred again and was reset by power down and up.This battery comes with a cable to update the firmware should GoPro change the software on the camera. This cat and mouse game can leave you with a non working battery while you wait on the next battery update.Product support was sterile asking me to supply all the purchase documentation and read unreadable black ink on a black battery for a lot number. I gave up and returned the units.</p>

<h5 id="inconsistent-and-unreliable-for-gopro-hero-5-black">Inconsistent and unreliable for GoPro Hero 5 Black.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This product has many reviews that state the batteries do not hold a charge. I used these 2 batteries and my OEM GoPro battery on a recent hiking trip through Yosemite NP at elevations up to 11,000 feet. My camera was the GoPro Hero 5 Black. All batteries were fully charged before using them. The GoPro battery worked perfectly and held a good charge. The first Wasabe battery worked ok for a few minutes then I received a &ldquo;low battery&rdquo; warning and it showed 0% on the display before shutting off. The battery should have been more than 95% charged. I then took the battery out and reinserted it and it worked ok for a few minutes and then I received the same warning and it shut off. Then I switched to the 2nd Wasabe battery and it did the same. Both of the Wasabe batteries malfunctioned. I used an external charger to recharge my GoPro battery and stuck with that for most of the trip.I retried the Wasabe batteries after a few days and they initially seemed to work OK at or near sea level but worked inconsistently above 5,000 feet. I believe the low battery warnings are not because they won&rsquo;t hold a charge. I believe they have a connection problem with the GoPro camera &ndash; a DESIGN FLAW that did not happen with the OEM battery.After arriving home at sea level, I spent time trying to get the batteries to replicate the same behavior that they did above 5K without success. However, I have VERY low confidence in them and if I wanted some reliable video, I cannot rely on these Wasabe batteries because I cannot determine when they will or won&rsquo;t work. I hope the company addresses the issue and will REPLACE these and fix the problem. In the meantime, if you own a GoPro camera, use a GoPro battery. Yes, maybe it costs a few bucks more but GoPro works reliably.</p>

<h5 id="gopro-s-suck-batteries-faster-anything-on-this-planet">GoPro&rsquo;s suck batteries faster anything on this planet</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I. HAVE. THE. POWER! Seriously, GoPro&rsquo;s suck batteries faster anything on this planet. Sure, I forget to turn it off when I&rsquo;m done recording, but it&rsquo;s not my fault. I really do want 40 minutes of shaky upside down video of me walking around on a Saturday with the kids. So when that happens, I always have several of these Wasabi Power batteries with me. I even take the charger since I can power up in the car. These are just as good as OEM batteries and I&rsquo;ve had no problems with the latest firmware update for GoPro Hero5.I have however had problems storing all the useless footage I shoot. Looks like it&rsquo;s external hard drive time. Thank God for Amazon&hellip;</p>

<h5 id="good-for-the-price">good for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>good for the price, but doesn&rsquo;t seem to last as long as the original GoPro batteries, but again, for the price, its worth buying.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="four-stars">Four Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Charges my two Gopro -5 batteries to 100% without any problem, LED indicators for charge status really helpful.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Works perfect with GoPro Hero 5, charges fast.</p>

<p>Exceptional value, quality and delivered much more quickly than expected. Thanks!</p>

<h5 id="latest-firmware-with-zero-issues">Latest firmware with zero issues</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was having a problem with my original GoPro batteries, specifically that they wouldn’t charge using a usb c cable into the GoPro itself.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-compatible-with-gopro-hero-5">NOT COMPATIBLE WITH GoPro Hero 5!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked a couple of times with GoPro Hero 5, but after that it would go to zero battery immediately after turning on, as others have complained.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="drain-too-fast">Drain too fast!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These were not working as expected. They drain too fast even when fully charged. One minute battery shows at 90%.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="doesn-t-work-with-v2-51">Doesn&rsquo;t work with V2.51</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t work anymore after updating to V2.51.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="1-dead-battery-and-the-2nd-barely-holds-a-charge">1 dead battery and the 2nd barely holds a charge</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to save some money so I bought these 3rd party batteries for my GoPro. One of the batteries is already dead and the other doesn&rsquo;t hold a charge well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great alternative to buying official Gopro batteries. No problems with latest firmware 2.51.</p>
