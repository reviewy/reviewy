<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="excellent-product">Excellent product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Case fits like a second skin. Feels solid and secure, all buttons line up perfectly, and ports are covered with plugs. Screen protector fits flush without bowing. I couldn&rsquo;t be more pleased with this purchase!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-tab-a-10-1-case">Great Tab A 10.1 case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I waited 13 days for this case even with Prime because of a massive snow storm here. Good thing is that it was worth it. It is very well built and very sturdy. The built in screen protector is nice but definitely not the greatest quality. You could be removed if you wanted to, But I left it on for now. What I liked best is that it had room under the plastic screen protector to not impede with my ballstic glass screen protector already on it so it is double covered as of now. The inside plastic case was kind of hard to get out the first time, but once it is out and the Tab A is installed the outside rubber actually locks around the outside plastic. It&rsquo;s kind of hard to explain without seeing in person, but it is a very good design. Without a doubt I would buy it again and if anything ever happens to this one, I will definitely buy another one.</p>

<h5 id="probably-the-best-galaxy-tab-a-10-1-case-on-the-market">Probably the best Galaxy Tab A 10.1 case on the market</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very Well Built, Sturdy Case. I was hesistant to purchase this because of the lack of reviews, but it seems like there aren&rsquo;t many good cases for the Galaxy Tab A 10.1 and this is the best I&rsquo;ve found.The buttons are raised and easy to manipulate, and they match very well. The case fit&rsquo;s snugly, and the built in screen protector is adequate. It definitely feels better in your hand with the case on it.My only drawback to this case is that there&rsquo;s no opening to add or remove the MicroSD cards, you have to take the case completely off to change the card.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-case-i-have-ever-bought">The Best Case, I have ever bought</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Everything has been said. I just wanted to add that, I bought my tablet at Costco store, which seems like is a different size from others. So if you bought yours in Costco, this is the perfect case for your tablet. I bought 2 cases somewhere else, and none were the right size. even tough, there were labeled as 580. Also, it was a faster delivery as advertised by 2 days which was a plus, but mainly what I was really expecting was that the case fitted right my tablet, and it did. In one, very happy with this Moko case. Ah and it came very well packed, very professional. Worth every penny</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="another-great-product-from-moko">Another great product from Moko</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Another great product from Moko. This case coves the entire device including the screen with built-in screen protector. Fit is perfect. Solid protection all around.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-set-up-and-feels-great">Easy set up and feels great.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Just got this case to nite. After unbagging it, separate the screen Arab of the case from the bottom. It is no hard. Just roll the corner and separate the two half&rsquo;s. Leave the screen protect on for now. Once opened place tablet into screen protector. But remove film from inside the screen protector. Now aline the tablet in the bottom case so that the controls and openings for plug and headset are all a lined. Then push both pieces together an adult for good and a lined fit. Now remove the film on the exterior of the screen. Now enjoy. Less than five minutes. Note, the screen has an interior and exterior film on it. Remove both. Screen is very responsive. I am typing this on it. Feels good in your hand and for twenty bucks. You can go wrong. I will post an updated review in the future. At this point, I will give the five stars for setup and ease of use. I believe it will end up a Five Star review. I am loving it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="world-class-case-with-one-flaw">World class case with one flaw</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A very nice case. Rugged. Solid. Hard-rubber-like around all the edges and corners. Handsome and well-made.The only reason I&rsquo;m holding back 1 star (4 instead of 5) is that the built-in screen protector has absolutely no anti-glare. Depending on the lighting in the room (and especially if you&rsquo;re outdoors) - it is very reflective; almost like a low-grade mirror. I like the protective part so well, though, that I am going to attempt to remove the transparent screen protector tonight. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="easy-to-install-but-i-do-recommend-that-you-include">Easy to install but I do recommend that you include &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Fits very well and all cutouts are aligned. Wish the kickstand was a bit longer. Easy to install but I do recommend that you include a simple instruction sheet for a novice.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="one-star">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t fit and return shipping cost half the price of the cover.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent cover and protection</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-heavy-duty">Not Heavy Duty</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Kick stand flimsy, screen protector gives off way too much glare</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="five-stars-1">Five Stars</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Case is great</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-quality">Good Quality</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good quality. Had no problems. have been using it for close to a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-case-to-start-with-hopefully-it-hold-up-well">Excellent case to start with! Hopefully it hold up well.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice case. The cutouts in the screen protector fit perfectly. I don&rsquo;t know if I have ever had a screen protector with the cutouts as good as this.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="broken-kickstand-in-2-months">Broken kickstand in 2 months</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This fits well and is very protective. The only problem is that after just 2 months, the kickstand has completely broken off. The case is also very difficult to take off.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-case">Good case.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Protects good for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-case">Perfect case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Perfect case for homebound tablet,just the right bulk,returned two others because it made tablet 3 times the size,removed screen saver and it&rsquo;s perfect,</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice">Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice fit, only note I have is that it would be nice to have a screen cover which could fold over as heavy as the back cover.</p>
