<h5 id="great-value-powerful-versatile-and-quick-to-recycle">Great Value: Powerful, Versatile, and Quick to Recycle</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a journalist I rarely use an off-camera flash but I also accept an occasional portrait gig. Just before a recent shoot, my ancient Vivitar slave flash croaked. I ordered this unit as an affordable step up to compliment the Metz Mecablitz 50 that lives atop my Nikon 7100. The M800N is now my main on-camera flash, and I am thinking of picking up a second one to slave. The M800N talked with the Nikon for all functions including HS (FP) flash without a single hiccup. It is powerful and FAST. With fresh batteries, it recycled in under 0.5 seconds, almost as fast as you can shoot single shots. This is a very good flash unit at a price point that makes it a bargain. Only downside IMHO is that it is a little bulkier than some of its competitors.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="impressive-so-far">Impressive&hellip;so far&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m a very skeptical when it comes to off brand camera gear. After shopping around and looking at various reviews, I decided on these over the other third party brands, and purchased two of them. I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to use them yet on a shoot, but in my initial tests at home, they had faster recycling times than my Nissin di866 and was also compatible with my 5D Mk III. I was able to fire off about a dozen shots in continuous mode at <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> power with no lag time and very little decrease in exposure. So far, I am very happy with these speedlights and will most likely be back for a couple more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="but-once-i-get-a-better-grasp-on-it-all-i-will-feel-more-confident">but once I get a better grasp on it all I will feel more confident</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have recently taken up photography as a hobby to take photos of my family as well as flowers around the garden and wildlife. It was suggested that instead of spending an enormous amount of money on lighting setups, that I invest in a speedlite that attaches via hot shoe, but could also be used standalone and has TTL, which this does.This speedlite has vastly improved my photos and I am just beginning to use it and do not have all of the settings figured out yet. I have been using it on my Rebel T5 and so far I have been loving the results. Getting the settings just right has been a little tricky because I am a beginner, but once I get a better grasp on it all I will feel more confident, watch out.It does add a little weight to your camera as you would imagine but it&rsquo;s not that heavy. It takes 4 AA batteries and surprising enough it does not eat through them. It seems pretty conservative so far and I have been using it quite a bit. At the time I took the photos I have included my sons were asleep so I grabbed the closest doll I could find, which happened to be Chucky.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-flash-for-the-price">Great flash for the price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>great output and refresh, I prefer this over my $500 canon speedlight. The overall construction isn&rsquo;t as good as the higher end flash, but the functionality is every bit as competitive as the other units. I find it to be a little cheaper construction which is expected for the price, but I would not hesitate to get it again for every day flash photography. It would set up nicely as an umbrella flash for portable studio ligthing</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="so-far-much-better-than-expected">So far much better than expected</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Coming off a canon 250exii, the photoolex is as good if not better. I have only used it for indoor shooting so far, and it has done well for me in this realm. The egronomics are great, the flash rotates with ease. It feels just as durable as any canon brand flash. Battery life is great, definitely not draining as quickly as I thought from an inexpensive flash. Time may tell differently later, but I&rsquo;d recommend this flash any day over name brand ones.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="product-is-great-i-enjoyed-using-it-because-it-is-easy-to">product is great I enjoyed using it because it is easy to &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>product is great I enjoyed using it because it is easy to set up with my Canon Rebel t4i. Ive taken photography classes online so to understand more about photography and how important lighting is for a great and sharp photos. This Photoloolex is a great deal. Comes with manual instructions for better understand of usage ( for beginners like me ) Angular tilt for better light bounce is awesome. I love the LCD as you can see your options clearly even in a dark areas. Supports ETTL II,ETTL,M,MULTI,S1,S2. This helped me a lot achieve great shots for portraits and group photo sessions. I love and it is a great deal for the price.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="you-get-more-bang-for-less-buck">You get more bang for less buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This flash is a steal considering it is only $99.99. The buttons function as perfectly as the camera&rsquo;s manufacturer&rsquo;s flash. This has a great weight presence and the battery life for regular work at a wedding is the same as the manufacturer&rsquo;s flash. This synced up with my camera &amp; it&rsquo;s manufacturer flash with perfect ease. The angle &amp; rotation of the flash head is within normal limits and easily accepts all after market flash hoods. The instructions that come with this unit are easy to read and works step by step without any malfunctions. I can use this as a master or slave easily with my Nixon flash.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I replaced a Canon speedlight that got damaged with battery leakage&hellip; I was looking for an inexpensive replacement that would work for the time i needed better flash than the built in unit&hellip; This flash was highly recommended by others so I took a chance and was happy I did, much bigger than the unit i replaced but more light and better features at a lot less than the Canon modelThis is a great value for photographers who want the flexibility of an off-camera flash.</p>
