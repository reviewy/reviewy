<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="well-made-and-inexpensive-however-slow-charging-using-lg-g3-phone">Well-made and Inexpensive, however, Slow Charging using LG G3 phone.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two of these due to their low cost and apparent high quality.PROs:The panels are well made and provide good power at 5 volts (5.12v in full sunlight).They are light and durable, easy to take in a backpack.CONs:These panels only produce 5 volts so there really is no option to recharge a 12v battery.My LG G3 phone charges at .6 amps only. I have hung multiple batteries on the same output USB plug and have seen higher currents so I know the panel can produce higher currents but my LG G3 phone refuses to enter fast charging mode using this panel.Summary:A well made solar panel. I plan to connect my 20,000 mAH EasyAcc charger to both solar panel outputs to charge the battery via two USB outlets then fast-charge my phone using the EasyAcc battery to overcome the slow charge using the solar panel alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-camping-investment">Great camping investment</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Worked great on my most recent camping excursion. Charged my phone, power packs, and camp lights all weekend with it. Worked faster than expected in bright direct sunlight, gave my phone and a power bank a full charge in just over an hour. It charged slower on overcast days, but the 30% charge an hour it provided was quite reasonable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="highly-recommended-for-price">Highly Recommended for Price</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s a quality product and seemingly well made. I&rsquo;ve used it on the rare sunny days of a northern US winter through a window and it was worked well. I&rsquo;ve been working in the solar space for a while and know first-hand that many times, these products at a lower price point don&rsquo;t often work well, but this product does.I&rsquo;m awaiting a more solar-friendly season to really put this charger to use. I do recommend it for the introductory solar product user who doesn&rsquo;t want to spend $100+.</p>
