<h5 id="perfect-power-bank">Perfect power bank</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a very nice portable power bank. I was looking for one I can use while traveling because I have been taking many flights recently so I can confirm that it is allowed on domestic flights because I didn&rsquo;t have any issues yet while going through security.*I do have pre-check so that when going through security I do not need to remove any electronics so I can&rsquo;t say for sure about the normal security or international flights on allowing this on flights.*This battery pack is thin so that it fits in the small purse I have. It is about the same size and thickness as my iPhone 6s Plus. I have a really long charging cable so that I can still use my phone while charging it with this battery in my purse or bag or I can simply put both into my bag and allow it to charge while walking around or not using my phone.I have charged my phone while using it and the phone itself does get slightly warm but it still charges fairly quickly while using the phone. I don&rsquo;t know how many full charges this battery stores as I have not used it enough yet to charge my phone more than 2 times on one charge but it&rsquo;s great that I can get those 2 full charges and possibly more out of it because it has 2 charging ports so that both mine and my husband&rsquo;s iPhones&rsquo; can be charged at the same time so we don&rsquo;t have to worry about who gets to charge their phone or when.This power bank comes with a USB light that has a soft enough light for reading and an on board light that is brighter than the USB light. There are also status lights on the power bank that indicates the remaining battery level. There are 4 of these lights that light up blue and each represents approx. 25% power remaining. 4 lights =100% power, 3 lights =75% power, 2 lights = 50% power, and 1 light = 25% power.*Please keep in mind that these are only estimates and not exact numbers.Thanks for reading my review. If it was helpful to you, let me know by hitting the ‘yes’ button below my review. If it did not help you, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer any further questions you may have about the product.</p>

<h5 id="light-weight-and-easy-to-bring-wherever-i-go">Light weight and easy to bring wherever I go</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Ultra slim design. Just a tad larger than my iPhone 6S and about the same thickness. Light weight and easy to bring wherever I go. Much needed for my battery draining devices. 2 USB outputs, 1A and 2.1A, using mostly the 2.1A if charging 1 device. Double click the on button turns on the mini flashlight. Not needed but has the option. Casing made with aluminum like those external hard drives. Thin enough to fit in my front jean pocket with the iPhone without feeling too bulky. With a full charge of the power bank, I&rsquo;m able to charge my iPhone 6S 5 times which is very handy when I&rsquo;m traveling and I like to pack light. It also comes with a bonus USB LED mini lamp to connect to the power bank which I wasn&rsquo;t expecting and it works really well.</p>

<h5 id="i-love-it-so-much">I love it so much</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Finally I found this product, I like it so much. Press twice can be turn on the led light when I got home late. I could use it as flash light. And I love the extra small cute flash light. I could use it at night for reading when we go to bed. It&rsquo;s cool feature if you needed additional light.It quick charge form my phone, able to charge 4-5 times. very slim and really handy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Very nice compact Power bank with light and lamp - i didn&rsquo;t knew that lamp will come seperately that was a surprise for me so far very happy with this - it charges my mobile 2 times 100% and i was using the mobile too the whole time.</p>

<h5 id="very-slim-and-light-weigth-high-capacity-faster-charging-for-fitbit-love-it">Very slim and light-weigth - high capacity - faster charging for Fitbit - Love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This power bank is very slim in size, and it’s also very light-weight. This is the power bank I like to carry it in my daypack when I am out of the house.The status light is blinking when charging. When I use this power bank to charge my iPhone 6S, I notice that it charges at the same speed as my wall charger. However, it does charge Fitbit much faster. It takes only 30 minutes to charge my Fitbit HR fully, and I am very happy to get such a short downtime for my Fitbit.This power bank comes with 2 USB output ports – this is my first power bank that offers 2 output ports. This is really handy because I frequently need to charge my iPhone and Fitbit at the same time. The power bank automatically shuts off when the devices are detached from it.The 4 power status lights provide a good indication on the power strength of the power bank, so you can plan on recharging the power bank as needed.I also like the extra flashlight comes with this power bank – it’s very bright and can be used in situations when a strong flashlight is needed.This power bank has a high capacity and is able to fully charge my iPhone 6S 4 times before I need to recharge it again. I find it a very useful device when I am outside of the house, and in needs of battery boost on the iPhone or Fitbit. Highly recommended!</p>

<p> This is a nice battery. It charges quickly and quickly charges my devices. I like that I can charge up to two devices at one time. I purchased this because we have a boat and I always like to take a few battery packs with me or otherwise we are constantly fighting over the charger with the teenagers. IT&rsquo;s thin, it fits in my back pocket. It also came with a little light and micro usb cord.</p>
