<h5 id="good-but">Good, but&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ll give it a 5 star for how well it works. I love how I can have all the attachments with one tool. But I was very disappointed that the crimper attachment did not come with the set like it says.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="perfect-christmas-present-for-your-teen-or-the-hairstylist">perfect Christmas present for your teen or the hairstylist</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This review is for the Remington Hair Tools set:Looking for that perfect Christmas present for your teen or the hairstylist??Thumbs up for the professional style interchangeable hair tools kit by Remington.Not only do you get a curling iron and a straightener, you also get a special spiral sleeve specifically to make spiral curls, and the straightener attachment is reversible, becoming crimper plates to crimp your hair. They also include 4 hair clips to help hold hair out of the way while you&rsquo;re styling it. All of this comes in a black zippered kit that has little pockets for each attachment and accessory. Easy to use and easy to transport.</p>
