<p>From the Manufacturer
Maintaining good oral health is easy with the Philips Sonicare ProResults Standard toothbrush heads. Designed to work with multiple Sonicare models, these snap-on replacement brush heads feature a large surface area and radial-trimmed, contoured bristles to thoroughly clean and massage teeth and gums. The blue reminder bristles fade to let you know when it&rsquo;s time for replacement. Replace your brush head every three months for best results.</p>

<p>Snap-on replacement brush heads feature a larger surface area and radial-trimmed, contoured bristles. View larger.</p>

<p>Angled Bristles Cover Larger Surface Area
The curved surface area created by the brush head&rsquo;s radial-trimmed bristles help you maintain contact with the surfaces of the teeth and gums as the brush head pivots.</p>

<p>The bristles&rsquo; contoured pattern fits the natural shape of your teeth. Peaks and valleys along the length of the brush head are ergonomically designed to fit between teeth, so you&rsquo;re less likely to miss places when you brush. This means you can remove more disease-causing plaque for a healthier mouth.</p>

<p>Replace Every Three Months
You can&rsquo;t see it, but your brush head wears over time. Blue reminder bristles fade in color to let you know when it&rsquo;s time to replace the brush head. Dental professionals recommend replacing your brush head every three months. Sonicare technology helps you remove more plaque than a manual toothbrush.</p>

<p>Fits Multiple Sonicare Handles
The ProResults Compact brush head works with the following Sonicare models: DiamondClean, FlexCare+, FlexCare, HealthyWhite, and EasyClean.</p>

<p>The heads easily snap onto handles and come with caps for hygienic storage and travel.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s in the Box
Four ProResults Standard toothbrush heads and four hygienic travel caps with frustration-free packaging.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="fake-sonicare-see-attached-photos-for-proof">Fake Sonicare - see attached photos for proof</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are fakes. I tried to save money by ordering Sonimart brushes. Read my review of Sonimart brushes. So I still wanted to save money over buying from the stores and bought these on Amazon. Imagine my surprise when a bristle came out with the second brushing. I looked more closely and compared them to my old Philips Sonicare ProResults brushes. (I save my old brushes to clean jewelry and hard-to-get-at items.)In photo 1, note the heads are slightly different&hellip;the fake is on the right with slightly shorter bristles and one sticking out that had come loose&hellip;the real one on the left is well-used and faded with longer bristles at the end. In photo 2, note the real one has &ldquo;ProResults&rdquo; clearly stamped on a slightly thicker stem and the fake one has a slightly fuzzy &ldquo;PHILIPS sonicare&rdquo; stamped its stem. In photo 3, note the real one on the right has a rectangular extrusion along the inside of the hole and the fake one on the left does not have that rectangular extrusion. As you can guess, I am returning these to get my money back.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="poor-quality-bristles">Poor quality bristles</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Totally disappointed the bristles fall out. I thought it might have been just the head I was using so I changed it and it&rsquo;s doing the same, very frustrating. Poor quality I hope it&rsquo;s just the batch.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="4-for-the-price-of-3">4 for the price of 3</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a couple of reviews that said this was a knockoff product, but if you search the Phillips website, they do sell a 4 pack in a brown box like this one. When these arrived they were identical to the heads we had purchased from Walmart and fit our toothbrush without any issues.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-toothbrush">Great Toothbrush</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These toothbrush heads are great. They are often difficult to find in stores; I have since discovered that there are several models of Sonicare toothbrush that utilize these heads which may be some of the cause in difficulty to find.There is a handy blue indicator built in to some of the bristles that turn white gradually with use to alert you when to replace the brush head. This seems to happen earlier than it should, often suggesting replacement in less than one month, which would become quite expensive at the cost of these. Price on the replacement heads does seem to be somewhat excessive, especially since Sonicare removed the magnets from use in this line of of electric toothbrush creating a brush head that has less plastic than a manual brush. When bought in bulk however, it becomes more comparable to the price of nicer manual toothbrushes.All in all however, I do prefer this toothbrush and the smaller size of these replacement heads to a manual brush. I highly recommend the brand and have been happily using it for the last decade.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="no-counterfeits-in-the-plain-brown-box">No counterfeits in the plain brown box&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These are mighty pricey, especially compared to Oral B heads, but when you drop a toothbursh head in the toilet&hellip; well, there&rsquo;s very little choice.I opted for the Amazon &ldquo;frustration free&rdquo; packaging after coming across a few reviews of counterfeit heads. It seems to me that Amazon would only source their heads from a known entity. Sure enough, the heads come loosely packed in a nondescript cardboard box, and they appear to be the real deal. The box also includes three additional color rings (all the heads come with the gray ring pre-installed).The one oddity is that instead of having &ldquo;ProResults&rdquo; printed on the shaft, the heads instead have a Sonicare logo. But they look exactly like the ProResults heads that came with the toothbrush, and they fit equally well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="the-best-of-a-handful-of-average-options">The best of a handful of average options.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that these bristles held up as long as the ones that were originally packaged with my sonicare toothbrush, but I also have no reason to believe that they&rsquo;re generic or &ldquo;fake&rdquo; brushes either. They&rsquo;re much better than the truly generic, 3rd-party replacement heads.The package is easy to open and recyclable, which is nice, and the price is better than buying them elsewhere. I did receive all four and although I wished they lasted a little longer, I have no evidence to suggest that a competing brand would last any longer. I&rsquo;m not thrilled by these, but they are probably the best of any replacements I&rsquo;ve tried yet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="love-the-new-packaging">Love the new packaging.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been using the Sonicare Pro Results toothbrush for about three years now. We love the toothbrush, and the toothbrush heads are also great. They aren&rsquo;t cheap, especially since you need to replace them every three to four months. But they sure do get your mouth clean. I haven&rsquo;t had a cavity in ages. Overall, I say they are worth the price&ndash;especially when you get them from Amazon, shipped quickly and in easy-to-open, plastic-free packaging.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="they-are-not-knockoffs-real-sonicare-brushheads">They are not knockoffs! REAL Sonicare brushheads</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I first got these, I really thought they were knockoffs. However, Sonicare does, indeed, sell four pro results brushheads in this type of a package.They fit into my genuine sonicare flexbrush just fine without any issues.In addition to these, I have also used the diamond clean and the hydroclean as well as the standard. I like to mix it up every few months because I feel each one of them cleans a little bit differently.However, with that said, these are probably my favorite. They leave my teeth feeling the cleanest. The diamond clean are nice, but too expensive and not really worth that much more than these heads. The nice thing about them is that they don&rsquo;t seem to break down as quickly.These brushheads are supposed to last you three months, but I don&rsquo;t think they really do&hellip;they are more or less done for me in about 2 months. I brush twice a day, morning and evening, just to give you perspective.Anyway, these are the genuine brushheads you are looking for. They work well with the brushes they are rated for. They give your teeth a good overall clean. They do not simulate flossing like the hydroclean. They are offered at a pretty good price here (though still expensive compared to regular brushes of course).Proceed with confidence.</p>
