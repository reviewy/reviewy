<h4 id="product-description">Product Description</h4></li>
</ul>

<p>The SimpleLight for Kindle 4th Generation is an elegantly designed accessory that allows you to enjoy your Kindle in low-light environments, like on an airplane, or in your bed at night, without the need for additional batteries.</p>

<p>NOTE: This SimpleLight is only compatible with the previous entry-level Kindle, the one with the five (5) buttons below the screen, and the Next/Previous Page buttons on the left and right edges. Kindle not included. It is not compatible with the latest entry-level Kindle, the Kindle Keyboard, Touch, Fire or Voyage.</p>

<p>ADDITIONAL FEATURES</p>

<ul>
<li>Slim profile does not significantly increase the Kindle&rsquo;s footprint.</li>
<li>Lightweight. The SimpleLight weighs only 1.6 ounces.</li>
<li>Uses the Kindle&rsquo;s own battery for power. No batteries required.</li>
<li>Has minimal impact on the Kindle&rsquo;s battery life.</li>
<li>Turns on automatically when the arm is removed from its locked position.</li>
<li>Turns off automatically when the Kindle enters sleep mode.</li>
<li>Flexible arm allows for multiple lighting angles.</li>
<li>Four (4) LEDs provide ample coverage of the Kindle&rsquo;s screen.</li>
<li>Fits our SimpleSleeve or SimpleCase for Kindle (each sold separately on Amazon)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Kindle enters sleep mode either manually (you press the power button), or automatically (after 10 minutes of inactivity). No worries about draining the battery if you fall asleep while reading. When you have finished reading, you can simply return the light to its locked position.</p>

<h5 id="a-must-have-for-kindle-4">A Must Have For Kindle 4!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have bought 5 of these lights so far for my 72 year old Mothers favorite Kindle. I bought her a Fire but she just loves 4th Generation Kindle better, and as an avid reader she cannot be without a light. She has tried many other lights but none compare to the SimpleLight. After about a year or so of constant use. (Mom is never seen without her Kindle.) The arm won&rsquo;t stay up anymore and I buy her a new one. Thank you for continuing to make these. We would be lost without them.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="another-wonderful-kindle-light">Another wonderful Kindle light!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I had an original Kindle and the first version of the Simple Light - loved both of them. The light was lost in an unfortunate accident and I ordered another. When it came and I went to put it on the Kindle, I discovered that the Kindle had died. Thanks to awesome customer service at Amazon I got a refurbished Kindle, but it was the newer model and the Simple Light didn&rsquo;t work with it.When I sent the light back, I got an email from Grantwood asking why I had returned it - I told them the long sad story and they informed me that there WAS a light for the new Kindle. I am now back in &ldquo;happy camper&rdquo; land and enjoying both.This light has the same flexible &ldquo;stem&rdquo; as the other, fits the Kindle perfectly, doesn&rsquo;t use batteries and (my favorite thing) falls asleep when the Kindle does.My ONLY complaint about this is that the newer version of the light doesn&rsquo;t show up in searches for either &ldquo;Kindle light&rdquo; or &ldquo;Grantwood Technology&rdquo; - Amazon needs to fix that.</p>

<h5 id="great-purchase">great purchase!!!!!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>perfect fit, good brightness but not over bearingflexible &amp; does at it describesgreat purchase worth the buy!!</p>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I think this is a great reading light. I&rsquo;m delighted to not have to worry about batteries anymore. It doesn&rsquo;t drain my kindle battery any faster but I&rsquo;m compulsive about charging my electronics anyway. I did have to turn my existing kindle cover around so that it closes on the left. The light arm of the SimpleLight would not allow for the cover to close using it the original way however the cover fit jsut fine over the light case. Making this adjustment has no affect on the light use, the case cover, how I read or anything else. It was just a little weird to remember to open it backwards for a few days. Now it&rsquo;s second nature.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="my-wish-come-true">My Wish Come True!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>When I wrote my review for the kindle I said that I wished that Grantwood Technology would make a light like the one they made for the earlier generation that ran off the kindle itself&ndash;and sure enough they did! I couldn&rsquo;t buy this fast enough as I was feeding my battery powered light every month only reading in bed for an hour a night&ndash;and that adds up over time. I&rsquo;ve had the SimpleLight for 10 days and I love it! Fits the kindle like a glove, appears to be well made, plenty of light and it fits very nicely in the Verso cover that I use. I love the fact that the light locks in place when not in use and is well protected&ndash;power draw from kindle is virtually undetectable&ndash;and if that isn&rsquo;t enough-I DON&rsquo;T HAVE TO BUY BATTERIES ANYMORE! Thank you Grantwood Technology! Try it, you&rsquo;ll love it!</p>

<h5 id="no-brainer-purchase">No brainer purchase!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Absolutely well designed product, totally innovative and hands down the best reading light for this generation Kindle. Everything fits perfectly, just clip it on and pull the light out to turn it on. I just wanted simple and functional and these guys deliver.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-best-invention-ever">This is the BEST invention ever</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the BEST invention ever! I have loved my kindle from the day I bought it. It literally took a busy new mom from not having time to shop for books and THEN read&hellip;to a more efficient workflow. I feel the same way about this light. The light is bright enough to read in full darkness. And honestly I love that I works off of the battery of the kindle. It can be annoying for your partner, but honestly at least I am no using an over head light.</p>

<h5 id="but-i-find-it-to-be-something-that-could-have-been-easily-avoided">but i find it to be something that could have been easily avoided.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Does exactly what is intended. provides light in low light situations without adding too much bulk to the kindle. only reasons to give 4 stars rather than 5 would be that it is actually a bit too bright, and that there are yellowed discolorations near the edges of the light beam. these discolorations are only at the very edges, so it can be angled to where they are off the actual reading surface, but i find it to be something that could have been easily avoided.</p>

<p>My wife is happy with this. Not all that bright or covers the entire tablet, but good enough</p>
