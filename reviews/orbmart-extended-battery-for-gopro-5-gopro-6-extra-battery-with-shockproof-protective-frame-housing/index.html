<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="power-with-weight">Power With Weight</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a good system but has limits due to added weight. In heavy action environments this system will break the typical Go Pro back plastic arm mounts. I lost a camera as it broke an arm mount. It needs a tether for sure but I recommend that you strongly consider the degree of shaking the mounting is subjected to. It is large and works great for stationary long term filming.</p>

<p>Everything fits expertly. Battery functions good. I’m happy with the product.</p>

<p>great i video games and it does last as it says 3hours</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-have-a-few-feature-requests">I have a few feature requests</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s great for what it is, but don&rsquo;t attach it to your GoPro until you need to use it, or the battery might get drained. I wish it had a power switch on it so that I could shut it off until I need it. I would&rsquo;ve been nice if there was a rubber gasket at the connection to make it at least water resistant. A place to store the GoPro&rsquo;s removed battery door would be nice as well. Please move the charging jack to the back so that I can access it while it is in the bracket.Other than that, it greatly extends the recording time of my Hero 5 Black, so I like it. Just make sure you don&rsquo;t connect them together until you need to use it, or you might find yourself with a dead battery.UPDATE (10-23-2017): It happened again. I left the extended battery connected to my Hero 5 Black, and when I turned it on, it only had 5% battery life but the extended battery pack had plenty of power. I don&rsquo;t know why this is happening but I&rsquo;m guessing it has to do with the circuitry inside the extended battery. Maybe it never turned on because my GoPro&rsquo;s built-in battery was initially full. Who knows. A hardware on/off switch would be very useful. Right now, I have to open the case, unplug the extended battery and plug it back in to make it start charging. Please please add a power switch!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-extended-battery">GREAT EXTENDED BATTERY!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased this extended battery because of the short battery life of the Hero 5. I use to use a power bank and a cable. But, I was getting tired of carrying it around. I use this mostly for long time-lapse. I&rsquo;ve made 3 time-lapse videos so far and the extended battery alone lasted 3 hours before using the GoPros battery. The case for the battery is just like the Hero 5 case. Very well made.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-add-on-for-the-hero5-black">Great add-on for the Hero5 Black</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After getting help from the company I was able to figure out how to use the battery correctly and I was doing it wrong before so I&rsquo;m changing my review. Its a great battery, you don&rsquo;t need to press the button the back to start the power flow to the camera where I was getting mixed up. Just turn the camera on and plug the battery into the side. Its starts giving power right away. Very helpful!</p>
