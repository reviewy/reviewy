<blockquote>
<p>26Dec15 Edit: A lot has changed since the Session came out. The price is much lower and some of the settings can be changed on the camera without a phone. This changes a lot, so my review below is heavily changed to update this new reality.BOTTOM LINE: You need to decide if you want a removable battery. If you don&rsquo;t plan on filming more than two hours at a time, the GoPro HERO4 Session is a great choice. If you don&rsquo;t want a camera with a view screen, and you don&rsquo;t need swappable batteries, this is the camera to get.I own a few GoPros. When the HERO4 Session came out it was $400, and quite frankly, the smaller size was not worth the price for most cases. But now at $200 the Session is competing with the lower tier GoPros, and it blows them out of the water.There are many different models, so I&rsquo;m going to boil them down into three choices. These are my overall recommendations for GoPros, including the Session.Choice #1: Price is the most important factor to you. Get the GoPro HERO. It&rsquo;s affordable ($129 for now), simple to use, and works great for many, many uses.Choice #2: You are willing to pay a bit more for some nice features, but you aren&rsquo;t a power user and you don&rsquo;t plan on filming over two hours of footage between charges. Get the GoPro HERO4 Session (the product for this review).Choice #3: You need a viewscreen on the camera, or swappable batteries, or don&rsquo;t care about price. Get the GoPro HERO4 SilverThe lack of a removable battery is a downside. While a 64GB memory card will hold a ton of footage, the battery will only last a couple hours. Not being able to swap the battery in a matter of seconds and start filming again means the larger memory card is less useful. This is a problem if you want to do really long timelapses, since the battery will run out every couple hours.For $200 this is a great camera, and it has become my go-to recommendation since the price cut. Some people (like me) need/want the additional features of the HERO4 Silver, but for most people the HERO4 Session is worth the extra $70 over the baseline GoPro price.Please feel free to ask any questions in the comments. Cheers!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>INTRO:I purchased a Gopro Hero 4 Session from a local sporting store as soon as it opened this morning (I just couldn’t wait). I have owned three Gopros, the first Gopro hero, the Gopro hero4 silver and the Gopro hero 4 session. For this review I will do a short comparison and talk about the Gopro Hero4 silver and Gopro session because these two cameras are both $399, which at first glance seems a little strange because the silver offer so many more features. For less reading you can also jump down to the bottom for my final thoughts or conclusion.COMPARISON:(For the point of comparison I am listing only the features that one camera has and doesn’t share with the other)Gopro Hero 4 Silver Features:-Touch screen display-4k resolution (yes only at 15 fps)-Many more premium video settings-Easy settings navigation and quick changing.-Familiar User interface and button orientation.Gopro Hero 4 Session Features:-Water proof without case.-Small size and light weight. (2.6 oz lighter than the silver with housing, and let’s face it for action sports you always have to have the housing on the silver)- Better audio while waterproof.FINAL THOUGHTS:I use this camera for mountain biking and other action sports. For years I have had my Gopro attached to my helmet, and despite its relatively small size and weight (5.2 oz), it does yank your helmet all over the place. This ruins the quality of the video and much more subjectively, it’s very annoying. Finally the Gopro has been cut in half with the new Session. I took the session out for a ride today and I could barely tell it was on my helmet, additionally the final picture is less shaky then the videos I have taken with my silver, not because of any fancy video stabilizer but because my helmet was not getting pulled all over my head.Now the session does have many fewer video settings than the silver, but to be honest for the sake of storage space and simplicity I have only ever used 1080p 30fps. So fewer settings does not concern me personally, and I don’t think anyone would be upset with the quality of this little beast.The only two issues I have is that it is harder to operate with the one button, and you are required to change settings using your smart phone. Also I am rough on my cameras and have had to replace the housing and housing lens before, this does not have the same bombproof housing as the silver, so I am using it a bit more carefully.CONCLUSION:So all in all it is not perfect, but for action sports, especially when used on helmet mounts I would take the Session over the Hero 4 silver any day.Additionally I am not affiliated with theverge.com but I do suggest you follow the link below to a more in depth review and for more picture comparisons. I agree pretty closely with the information represented on this website.I used the image shown because it was taken by a professional but is representative of the two go pros I have.Image courtesy of Theverge.com(<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/6/8887691/gopro-hero-4-session-camera-cube-hands-on">http://www.theverge.com/2015/7/6/8887691/gopro-hero-4-session-camera-cube-hands-on</a>)</p>

<h5 id="loop-recorders-look-elsewhere">Loop Recorders Look Elsewhere</h5>

<p>This has the potential to be so much better. Let me start with the positives. Fit and finish is superb as is the video quality. I use this as a chin mount on my motorcycle helmet and there&rsquo;s no noticeable drag or wind buffeting.Here&rsquo;s where it fails for my use which was mainly as an incident camera. There&rsquo;s no way to loop the video without turning on the GoPro&rsquo;s wifi and connecting the GoPro app on your phone. Looping is important as I may be on a 3+ hour ride and I just want it to keep recording and overwrite. Having wireless turned on for looping doesn&rsquo;t work for multiple of reasons, one the battery drains fast&hellip;really fast. I was planning on using a USB charger so not a deal breaker. But the bigger problem is while your phone is connected to the GoPro SSID, you won&rsquo;t have internet access on your phone. So no music streaming, navigation, etc. I love the size and the quality but I&rsquo;m seriously considering returning it.</p>
