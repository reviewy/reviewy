<h5 id="best-streamlined-diaper-i-ve-tried">Best streamlined diaper I&rsquo;ve tried</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Best streamlined diaper I&rsquo;ve tried. The Huggies little movers are super bulky compared the pampers. The Luvs are in the middle. But the Pampers are super thin and light and still hold the same amount of fluid. We haven&rsquo;t even had an overnight leak. I&rsquo;ve been looking for a more comfortable diaper and this one fits the bill. I took a picture of 10 Pampers Cruisers next to 10 Huggies Little Movers. The Huggies are just so much bigger but they don&rsquo;t do any more than the Pampers except make it harder for my baby to move around! She looks so much more comfortable in the Pampers. My only request, to ALL DIAPER MAKERS: STOP PUTTING DESIGNS ON THE DIAPERS. I hate how they show through her clothes and she can&rsquo;t see them anyway! Make them plain white, save time, save dye, save money and pass those savings on to us parents!!</p>

<h5 id="entire-box-defective">Entire Box Defective</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I am not one to write bad reviews, if I don&rsquo;t like something, I keep it to myself and move on. But literally every single diaper in this box is defective. I am unable to diaper my child right now because all the diapers are missing a tab to attach the diaper to the child. I am now in a desperate situation with no diapers because I received this box for my monthly subscription and I have no other diapers for my son. This issue is unacceptable, especially when it effects my child.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="i-prefer-swaddlers-or-baby-dry">I prefer Swaddlers or Baby Dry</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure why, but the size 3 Cruisers seem to be slightly larger on my son than the Swaddlers and Baby Dry. The Cruisers fit looser on his hips and have leaked a couple of times. Even though Swaddlers and Baby Dry are Pampers as well, the size 3 in those styles seem to fit much better and don&rsquo;t have this problem. I&rsquo;m sure that my son will grow into it, but I was surprised at the inconsistent fit between the different styles.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-great-i-won-t-be-buying-again">Not great. I won&rsquo;t be buying again.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought some of these for my special needs son who was outgrowing most other baby diapers and I didn&rsquo;t want to start using the &ldquo;depends&rdquo; type briefs.I find these to be cheap. Very thin, not very absorbent. Not like Pampers were about 10 years ago when I was diapering my older kids.They seem to barely stay on because the stretchy tabs stretch so far, that the diaper itself sags, even if barely wet.I ended up going back to size 6 Huggies Little Movers, which have a more substantial set of tabs/stretchy sides.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="leaked-on-my-average-sized-child">Leaked on my average-sized child</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used the Pampers Swaddlers, Baby Dry, and Cruisers, and these are my least favorite. They just don&rsquo;t seem to fit my son correctly, so any time he walks around, his diaper leaks. He&rsquo;s average height and weight, according to the growth charts, so it surprised me that the diapers didn&rsquo;t work. (Huggies didn&rsquo;t work for him, either.) I recommend staying with Pampers Swaddlers and Baby Dry.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="those-pampers-given-to-my-baby-were-amazing-with-the-urine-indicator-especially-for-me-and-hubby">those pampers given to my baby were amazing with the urine indicator (especially for me and hubby &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The newborn pampers was used in the hospital when I delivered my little one. I had bought the hypoallergenic, no bleach, natural and whatever else sensitive diapers thinking that that was what I should do to help in case my new born had a reaction to the name brand diapers. Well, those pampers given to my baby were amazing with the urine indicator (especially for me and hubby who were newbies at this) and there was never a reaction. We finished off the other diapers and just kept using the pampers because they were comparable in price and the subscribe and save had us sold. There were very few blow outs, and seriously&hellip;I dont think ANY diaper could have contained those few crazy blow out tsunamis! We are still using the pampers brand and little one is now at a size 4! love these diapers.READ MORE</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="cruising-with-pampers">Cruising with Pampers</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>We have had accidents (leaks) in these diapers, but only at night. My lo started holding it all night at an early age and if he has anything to drink before bed he might not make it through the night. This usually means a higher possibility for leaks. I can&rsquo;t really blame the diapers, since every brand we tried has given us the same result. They just aren&rsquo;t made to absorb so much so quickly. Other than the occational wet bed, these diapers are far superior to other brands of their type. I even prefer them to the other pampers (baby dry). They are soft and fit my son well. The tab never come loose or tears. They don&rsquo;t smell (unless soiled lol), and they don&rsquo;t irritate my lo&rsquo;s sensitive skin. I highly recommend!! I also participate in the subscribe and save. If you are an Amazon Mom member, subscribe and save will save you 20% on selected diapers. Saves you a ton, even compared to Walmart and Diapers.comREAD MORE</p>

<h5 id="still-on-the-hunt-for-a-good-diaper">Still on the hunt for a good diaper</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was hoping these would work great for my 7 month old. She&rsquo;s moving constantly. The pampers swaddlers are so thick and bulky and don&rsquo;t work fit her well at all anymore so we tried the baby drys. They didn&rsquo;t seem to last the full 12 hour mark for us and the fit was never right on her stomach so we tried the cruisers thinking they would work great for her. They fit her really well in the waist but get full so fast! I&rsquo;m changing her diaper atleast twice between feedings. They also leak which is a huge bummer. When she goes to bed at night she always wakes up wet now 🙁READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="do-not-buy-these-awful-diapers">DO NOT BUY THESE AWFUL DIAPERS!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pampers Cruisers are the WORST diapers we have ever used! My son leaks out of them in less than 4 hours. They are so thin that they tear when you try to secure the sticky sides.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="overall-i-think-the-qualify-is-much-better-than-now">overall i think the qualify is much better than now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>compared to swaddlers, this type is more easier to leave white tissue on baby&rsquo;s butt. I will not return that, but it is not worth for me to buy again.</p>
