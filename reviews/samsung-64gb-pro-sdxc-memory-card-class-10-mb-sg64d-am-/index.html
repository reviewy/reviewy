<blockquote>
<p>There is not much to say about this SDXC card - you already know it all. It is Samsung, works fine and most of all - actual speeds are as advertised. If you have got it for the promotional price then you made a great deal.Test was made with Transcend TS-RDF5K card reader and CrystalDiskMark 3.0.3b x64.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I use this card as my DAILY DRIVER on my Sony A7 Mark II. Taking pictures has been buttery smooth and my RAW files are ranging from 40MB to 60MB per file. Since my camera does at most for video recording at 1080i 50p, I don&rsquo;t think I would need a U2 or U3 the UHS-1 (Ultra High Speed)is working out well for me and my needs with this camera. My workstation is an i5 Kaby Lake processor custom build PC with 16GB ram of 3200mhz. I would transfer 60GB&rsquo;s of RAW images only from my Sony A7II and it would take about 20 mins writing from 50MB to 70MB per second.PROs:- U1 writes pretty quick and it all depends what workstation you use for read/write speeds on your PC/Mac.- Transfers fast to my workstationsCONs:- I always take precaution, I ALWAYS FORMAT when I first put it in the camera to make sure I&rsquo;m clear. Some cards can be defective or badly manufactured.- Sometimes the Lock slide will get stuck but, thats a manufacturing issue. I wouldn&rsquo;t give a bad rating cuz you get a lemon, mass production will always have that issue.- NOT RECOMMENDED FOR 4KSumming Up:I&rsquo;m basing this off my experience, I don&rsquo;t remove my card and put it into different cameras because it would corrupt the card. I leave one card dedicated to one camera and each time I stick in a new card, I format it so that the camera builds its file system through it from the start. Taking pics to recording videos and transferring RAWS to my workstations has always been a breeze. It&rsquo;s been over 6 months of use and I love this card.READ MORE</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I decided to buy Samsung Pro Samsung 64GB PRO Class 10 Micro SDXC up to 90MB/s with Adapter (MB-MG64DA/AM) as a main card for my two card Nikon D610 and saved some money on the second card and ordered a PNY Elie Performance PNY Elite Performance 64GB High Speed SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Up to 90MB/sec Flash Card - P-SDX64U1H-GE(both are 64GB SDXC UHS-1 cards).Samsung Pro 64gb SDXC UHS-1 card came without any storage box inside the blister pack.On the other hand PNY came with a decent case.My Nikon D610 will keep both busy anyway. Just a little detail.WARNING!!!!As one can see in the video, the plastic holder extends fairly far around the Samsung Pro card.Be VERY careful when you open the blister pack. This holder is as hard as the card itself.I have seen reports of people cracking the card in the process.Use a sharp knife to extract the whole holder out of the paper envelope.Here is a performance comparison:Reading speeds are fairly close at almost exactly the same 92MB/s for both.Samsung clocks ~80MB/s writing speeds while PNY is 22% slower at 62MB/s.Although Samsung is considered a more reliable of the two, I think the PNY card is a great bang for a buck - a great fall back card for a two card camera.Let time show any underwater issues that might arise in the future.So far, I am a happy camper.READ MORE</p>

<h5 id="fastest-card-i-ve-ever-used">Fastest card I&rsquo;ve ever used</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought this memory card for my canon t5i and I am really impressed at the speeds this thing is capable of. I typically go with a sandisk brand but the equivalent sandisk memory card (for speed and capacity) cost more than this card. I&rsquo;ve been trying Samsung SSDs lately and haven&rsquo;t had any problems so I took a chance with their memory card. It works great in my DSLR and my computer. I don&rsquo;t have a memory card reader that is fast enough to really test the speeds of the card but the card is definitely not the bottle neck. I&rsquo;m pretty sure the card is faster than the SD slot on my camera too. With my old card, my camera would spend a few seconds emptying the buffer after taking burst shots but with this card it clears the buffer almost immediately (taking jpg shots, not RAW or RAW + jpg). I have also taken HD movies with my camera and haven&rsquo;t had any issues with the card not keeping up. The longest video I&rsquo;ve taken so far was about 6 minutes and the card never skipped a beat. I imagine it is capable of recording video until either the card is full or the camera stops recording (I think the t5i only allows 30 minutes of continuous video). I would recommend this card to anyone who is looking for a fast SD card for a decent price.In order to utilize the UHS 1 class, you must have a newer card slot that can take full advantage of that speed or a USB 3.0 adapter (USB 2.0 will be too slow and will be a bottle neck if you want to use this card to its full potential). I have been using this card for about a month now and haven&rsquo;t had any issues.READ MORE</p>
