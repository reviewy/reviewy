<p>Package Type:Standard Packaging
Starting at 4GB, microSDHC cards offer higher storage for more music, more videos, more pictures, more games, more of everything you need in today&rsquo;s mobile world. The microSDHC card allows you to maximize today&rsquo;s revolutionary mobile devices. Kingston&rsquo;s microSDHC cards use the new speed class rating of Class 4 that guarantee a minimum data transfer rate of 4MB/ sec. for optimum performance with devices that use microSDHC. Identical in physical size to today&rsquo;s standard microSD card, the microSDHC cards are designed to comply with SD Specification Version 2.00 and are only recognized by microSDHC host devices. They can be used as full-size SDHC cards when used with the included adapter. To ensure compatibility, look for the microSDHC or SDHC logo on host devices (e.g., phones, PDAs and cameras). Wherever you find yourself in the mobile world, you can rely on Kingston&rsquo;s microSDHC cards. All cards are 100-percent tested and are backed by a lifetime warranty and <sup>24</sup>&frasl;<sub>7</sub> live technical support.</p>

<h3 id="product-reviews">Product Reviews</h3>

<h5 id="passed-all-benchmark-tests">Passed all benchmark tests!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WARNING! ONLY PURCHASE FLASH MEMORY FROM REPUTABLE ONLINE SELLERS LIKE AMAZON LLC. This card is sold by both Amazon, and multiple other marketplace sellers for cheaper but for a reason. If you try to save a buck and go with a market place seller then you will probably regret it. ALWAYS avoid said &ldquo;Bulk packing&rdquo;. That is a FAKE product, PERIOD! After visiting the official Kingston website for this card you will see that Amazon is a &ldquo;preferred online partner&rdquo; for the sale of this card. That absolutely DOES NOT include marketplace sellers. I can&rsquo;t stress enough the caution required to buy genuine flash memory. So please remember, only buy flash memory sold by AMAZON LLC. You will be able to see who is selling easily. Anyways, onto the review. I bought this for my HTC Flyer. Imediately after opening I ran a benchmark test using CrystalDiskMark and everything came out clear with true class 4 speed (4mb/s) a tested capacity of 7.4GB. I plugged it into my HTC Flyer and have noticed a huge increase in the speed of data transfer. (Upgraded from 2GB class 2) Otherwise I expect this card to perform admirably and I just ask that people be more careful in their online purchases.</p>

<h5 id="as-advertised">As advertised</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Came fast, works great, didn&rsquo;t have a memory error. Kingston is so quality I even spilled soda on the adapter, took it apart to clean, and was able to snap it right back together. The reason this is noteworthy is because if Kingston used cheaper plastic (A penny of difference, which separates trash from quality IMO) then it would of broke while I tried to open it up in the first place, let alone allow for the friction of snapping it back together without breaking the infinitesimally small latches.I just felt like that was worth pointing out, because it shows quality &amp; thought in manufacturing - the kind of which is scarce nowadays.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="kingston-brand-always-works-for-me">Kingston brand always works for me</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I purchased two microSD cards by two different makers. Kingston brand and another, lesser known brand. The Kingston went into my husband&rsquo;s LG 800G Prepaid Phone With Triple Minutes (Tracfone) and was recognized as external memory immediately (3.4 GB - not 4 GB, but that was expected as there is always some space loss due to operating system access). The included adapter worked as it should too, allowing me to load music onto the card from my Windows PC. By contrast, the other brand ( Patriot LX PRO Series Class 10 40MB/s UHS-1 32GB MicroSD Card at a faster speed and bigger size, had issues.Kingston is a brand of quality memory products that I&rsquo;ve used since building PC&rsquo;s in the 90&rsquo;s to present day. This product, like other SD and flash drives by Kingston that I currently own, is excellent quality and as described. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to buy it if you want a microSD card that works as it should, out of the box.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-card">Good card!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good card! Speeds measure accurately. Key features include:Compliant with the SD Specification Version 2.00Versatile when combined with the adapter, can be used as a full-size SDHC cardCompatible with microSDHC host devices; not compatible with standard microSD-enabled device/readersFile Format - FAT 32Ships in Certified Frustration-Free Packaging</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great-with-roku-2-3">Works great with Roku <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub></h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This Kingston 4 GB microSDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card works great with the Roku 2 or Roku 3 Media Player/Streamers and improve their channel/game load times. You only need a 2 GB as that is even more than the Rokus can actually use. This is the least expensive micro SD card that I found that met the Roku specification, which is: 2GB-32GB size range and speed class 2 or 4 or 6. Larger or Faster cards do not work at all or do not work reliably. The Roku&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t handle a class 10 or higher speed at all and if accepted will not be reliable. And again the size needed is only 2GB as to what the Roku <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> can use, but if you have an old one laying around or in can purchase one less expensive with larger storage up to 32GB they will work. Just use or purchase the least expensive micro SD card you can that meets the specs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="it-sucks">It sucks!!!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought two of these, one for my wife&rsquo;s phone and another one for my own phone, my wife have a Xperia x10 mini pro and I have a Nexus One, after 3 weeks or so, my wife&rsquo;s card was having issues, the phone did not recognize it, I had to reformated it several times, but It didn&rsquo;t work, I was thinking the issue was related to the phone and I changed it for a 4 GB MicroSD and that resolved the issue, I throw it away because I think it was damaged by the phone, but 2 days ago I had an issue with my card, I was scared because I have thousands of photos of my family and I was thinking that I will lose them, fortunately I was able to made a backup of my files, but after reformating the card it&rsquo;s not working well, my phone get freeze and I&rsquo;m not able to use all the apps that I have installed in the card, it sucks!!!!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-deal">Good Deal</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a new SD card for my phone and this is perfect. The price is great and it comes with the large adapter so you can upload pictures directly to your computer if you wish. Priced about the same or a little better than I have seen in the stores.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-inexpensive-memory-but-not-for-video-recording">Good inexpensive memory but not for video recording.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wanted to get a low cost memory card for my niece’s camera. All I was think about was price. Unfortunately, I did not consider speed. The memory performs very good for taking picture but when it came to using it for video there were significant delays. If you want a memory card for storage of information, then this card is fine. If you have a video device such as a Gopro then look for a higher performance card. There were no issues with memory corruption and write failures. The cost of memory cards has gotten so low I should have just spent the extra few dollars for a higher performance card.Please let me know if this review was helpful.</p>
