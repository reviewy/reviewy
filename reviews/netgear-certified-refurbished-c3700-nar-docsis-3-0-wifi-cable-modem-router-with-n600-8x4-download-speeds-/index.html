<h5 id="serious-flaws">Serious Flaws</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I own a small company, I save pennies where there&rsquo;s no harm to our operation. It&rsquo;s just good sense. Since refurbished means the device has been inspected and works as it should, I&rsquo;m a believer in refurbished devices. Practical and typically save 15-50%. Win!But refurbished does not mean inspected for this device - or they chose to send out a defective device. Neither case looks good for Netgear and this seller. Of the 2 wired ports one is completely defunct. Using speedtest.net to check it, it registers as .7mbps download and won&rsquo;t even register for upload speeds. The working wired port and wireless pull 110mbps down and 11mbps up - appropriate for my twc package.If you need multiple wired connection for additional devices - printers, etc. Don&rsquo;t trust these factory refurbished devices.Skip netgear or skip the refurb device.Update Nov 4, 2015, two weeks after 30-day return period closed - literally.The device officially died. Other uses complain about needing to frequently reset - this device failure is related to that. Wired and wireless ports all officially kicked. They hold signal for up to 60s and then drop signal completely (while measuring the coax for comparison purposes). This is not a matter of buffering to get over the hump, the device has narcolepsy. And now I am unable to return. $103 pissed out the window.You win some; you lose some.AVOID THIS DEVICE.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="don-t-do-it">Don&rsquo;t do it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This thing was fine for a couple of weeks until it no longer would proceed past &ldquo;Registration complete&rdquo; on Modem status page. I did attempt power cycling and did a factory restore, same condition. Plugged in a Motorola Surfboard and worked fine. Stay away from refubished network products. Using a standalone modem and Archer C7 router now happily. Just spend the money, it&rsquo;s not worth the headache to save a few bucks on this refurb.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="worked-for-45-days">Worked for 45 days</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This router modem combo works fantastic for 45 days and then the Wi-Fi started slowing down and getting slower and slower to almost stopped working. When it was new you had a good Wi-Fi signal throughout the whole house even upstairs but now after 45 days of use If you&rsquo;re working within 5 feet of the Wi-Fi it works pretty good if you are 15 feet away from the Wi-Fi you have basically no service. I would not recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="okay-for-cable-modem-but-wireless-router-was-dropping-wifi-almost-daily">Okay for Cable Modem but Wireless Router was Dropping WiFi Almost Daily</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The cable modem aspect worked fine but the wireless router was terrible. I had to reboot pretty much daily, otherwise the 5G wifi connection kept dropping across any of my devices (phone, tablet, laptop, TV). The 2G would still be available but that is much slower than 5G. I would not recommend if you will be using the the wireless router. If only cable modem, then might be okay.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="a-great-priced-modem-router-combo-for-when-my-modem-finally">A great priced modem/ router combo for when my modem finally &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Heck yes! A great priced modem/ router combo for when my modem finally gave in. Easy to set up and working great so far! The package contained instructions on how to get the serial number off your computer so just pull that up before you give your internet company a call (or while you are on hold) and you are good to go. Plus side: now that I have this, it cleaned up a lot of space rather than having the separate modem and router before. I see it didn&rsquo;t work for some reviewers but give it a shot ! You have 30 days to return it and I think it is well worth the savings.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="glad-i-got-this-one">Glad i got this one&hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure if buying the refurbished would be a great idea, but the new one wasn&rsquo;t ready to ship. As other reviewers have stated, they serial number is crossed out, and your internet company will need it, however the serial number was easily obtained by signing onto the router- something you would likely have done or had to do anyway! Write it down on the instructions, along with the password and you&rsquo;ll be in, and stay in business.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-device-for-xfinity-hi-speed-internet-connectivity">Excellent Device for Xfinity Hi Speed Internet Connectivity</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This device is fantastic !I upgraded my Xfinity line with 75 MBPS bandwidth recently. Wanted to avoid monthly modem rental with a affordable Netgear solution.I am getting ~75-80 MBPS on LAN and 50-55 MBPS on Wifi across my big apartment with 4-5 devices connected in parallel.Live Streaming, VPN, Screen Share, Gaming are working quite good. I am overall satisfied with the device.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="recommend-this-if-you-are-on-a-budget">recommend this if you are on a budget</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought the N600 refurbished. I originally bought an ARRIS SURFboard SBG6580 but it kept dropping the wifi so I returned it and got this instead. I have had this one for a full month now and it is great. It can cast the two 2.5 and 5 ghz wifi networks at the same time, my refurbished model looked like new. My apartment isn&rsquo;t that big about 1,000 square feet but it covers the entire thing with strong wifi signal no problem. I have ran speed tests in all rooms and I stream and download with multiple devices and the speed are great. Even during peak internet hours I still have no issues. I recommend this if you are on a budget and just trying to have good wifi in a medium apartment or small house. I can&rsquo;t say if this is good enough for a two story setup or a home with thick walls.</p>

<p>I &ldquo;updated&rdquo; to this from our old Cisco router thinking we&rsquo;d get better coverage and faster speeds but coverage is way worse and speeds obviously slower.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m getting 3mbps on this router vs 30mbps on my Comcast supplied router. I&rsquo;ve switched them out 3 times to be sure. Even time this router comes back 1/10th of the speed.</p>

<p>It worked ok for the first two months (occasionally I had to restart it to get either to 2.5 or 5.0 GHz band back up), but the most recent time I tried to restart it, it wouldn&rsquo;t&hellip;</p>

<p>Got it while back and this works without any issue for me still. Easy to set up.</p>
