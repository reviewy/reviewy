<h5 id="outstanding-case-for-an-epson-ex9200-pro-business-projector">OUTSTANDING case for an Epson EX9200 Pro Business Projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just purchased an Epson EX9200 Pro Business Projector. It came with a soft case, but I was looking for something that offered a little more protection. Stumbled on the WORKFORCE Hard Case and figured it would be better than nothing. Well, the case exceeded my expectations. It&rsquo;s made of hard plastic and accommodates my projector nicely. It&rsquo;s a little tight to close the lid with everything inside, but once closed it&rsquo;s sealed. I placed my cables and projector paperwork under the bottom foam, with the projector, remote control, and foam cut-out on top. Love this carrying case and seller was a real pleasure to deal with when I had an additional concern.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="projector-case">Projector Case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was looking for a case for a projector I just bought, so decided to try this one. The foam inside is easily manipulated so you have a space to fit the projector (the foam is scored so you can remove what you need). This case will work much better than the soft-sided ones. Not only do I have the projector in, but I was able to remove some foam along the edge to put the cords in as well. Great product and I know my projector will be protected when I transport it. Thank you!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-than-cardboard">better than cardboard</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case is perfect for my projector, an EPSON Home Cinema 730HD. A sheet of instructions for the best results is provided. Simple and clear, just the way I like it. The case is extremely light, but obviously durable. The foam padding is excellent. I used the punched out sections of the place holder foam to created more of a stacked padding underneath the projector. This was also great because I chose to punch out a hole for my remote and this stacked method prevented the remote from falling down and sinking in, which was happening before I put the extra fluff in. Definitely make sure to make it a tight fit for that extra secure feeling. I wasn&rsquo;t sure where to place my wiring, so just lay it between the projector and the remote, on top of the padding, and closed the case. I think from the pictures it shows that underneath the bottom layer of foam is best&hellip;but with my stacked foam method that would make a mess of all the small pieces - so I&rsquo;ll just keep doing what I&rsquo;m doing. I love the case so far and this is way better than keeping my moderately expensive projector in a cardboard box.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="solid-projector-case">Solid projector case</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Solid carry case. I bought it to hold a newly purchased protable projector. It fits the Epson EX 5250 with enough room to also tear out a little compartment for the cables.Tear away foam squares are my favorite destructive creation tool. I wish i got to play with them more often. One tip: measure your projector and mark the corners with white chalk or a light fabric pencil. The tear out one row less of squares than you measured in each direction. You can try the fit, and always tear out more if needed. In this case, I left on square connected in each corner, since my projector has rounded corners. The fit is ideal. If you need to add foam back, rubber cement works very well.The case itself is a good balance between protection and weight. It has just enough foam to have confidence, without being too large. I would not ship a projector in this case, or check it as baggage without further protection, but for a rugged grab and go projector case, this is perfect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="nice-basic-protection">Nice Basic Protection</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The case came when we were not home. The delivery driver just threw the box over our gate into the driveway. After a mild rain and our bulldog shredding the packaging all over the yard, it was still in perfect condition. We let it dry and then packed our projector in it. Our Vivitek D554 projector fits snuggly and still has room for cables and remote. Definite must for those who carry their projector from place to place.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="excellent-case-fits-many-projectors">Excellent Case - Fits Many Projectors</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>WORKFORCE Safe n Secure Video Projector Hard Case with Dense Internal Customizable Foam, Carrying Handle and Lockable Design - For Epson 3LCD, XGA, SVGA, 1080p and 3D Projectors - Models VS230 / VS330 / EX7235 / EX7230 Pro / EX5220 / EX3220 / 730HDSeveral cases are listed for different projectors, but cases seem to all be the same dimensions. Our projector is a Dell 1430X. I used a knife to slice through the the pre-scored foam blocks. The projector fits great. The case is medium weight and should work just fine for our purposes.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="decent-case-for-the-price-but-wouldn-t-go-on-the-road-with-it">Decent case for the price, but wouldn&rsquo;t go on the road with it.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Decent case for the price. I bought it for my ViewSonic PJD5155 projector, which turned out to be too big for the case. Even after I punched out a space in the padding, the case wouldn&rsquo;t close with my projector inside so I ended up removing the extra foam completely &ndash; and there&rsquo;s still no room for cables. Also, while most of the case feels pretty solid, the plastic near the clasps is a bit soft/flimsy. Not sure how much abuse it could take.It&rsquo;s perfect for my needs right now because I&rsquo;m not traveling, but the next time I go on the road I&rsquo;ll buy something sturdier/with proper padding (and enough space for cables) and just use this case for miscellaneous gear.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="has-a-good-grip-and-the-clasps-that-hold-it-shut">has a good grip, and the clasps that hold it shut &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a durable case with pick-foam lining for an odd-sized item and this one was the ideal choice. In my opinion, it could be a little thinner but having the added depth just means more foam around it for protection. The case itself is lightweight, has a good grip, and the clasps that hold it shut are sturdy but easy to actuate. The pick-foam itself is very simple to remove to customize the shape, and it took maybe 3-5 minutes tops for me to remove the right amount to get the perfect fit.</p>

<p>I like it a lot, i put it in a way that i can fit my NACON pro controller and it fits perfectly!!</p>

<h5 id="so-good">so good.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Case is high quality and sturdy&ndash;the foam in the case is serrated so you have to pull out each individual square which is time-consuming.</p>

<h5 id="easy-to-size-the-foam-and-really-protects-my-projector">Easy to size the foam and really protects my projector</h5>

<p>Easy to size the foam and really protects my projector, but snaps are cheap and pop off a lot. Expect it could be a problem in the future&hellip;</p>

<p>Safe</p>
