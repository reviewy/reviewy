<h5 id="the-thumb-sticks-are-more-rugged-and-have-better-grip-on-them">the thumb sticks are more rugged and have better grip on them</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I have definitely seen multiple improvements with these new PS4 controllers over the older ones. The battery lasts a lot longer, the thumb sticks are more rugged and have better grip on them, L2 and R2 buttons are more springy (good thing), and the thumb sticks also feel way smoother when moving them around. Other things I have noticed is that the buttons are now grey like the throwback controller and there is now a light on the touchpad. Although the last gen controllers are still pretty good, I would definitely recommend the new gen controllers for only $10 more.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="new-ps4-controller-and-definitely-an-upgrade">NEW PS4 Controller and definitely an Upgrade</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is the NEW PS4 controller. The easiest way to identify this is the blue LED bar in the front. The thumb sticks seem to be made of a denser, grippier material so that&rsquo;s an upgrade as well. Battery life is definitely better. Should have bought more to replace all my old ones&hellip; but oh well.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="controller-appreciation-post">Controller Appreciation Post</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ended up buying this controller as a bundle with my new PS4. I didn&rsquo;t get to choose the color of the second controller, and was automatically sent the red one, which I didn&rsquo;t think I would like (it being very flashy). However, when it came to unpacking my new PS4 I was at first struck by the design of the controllers and then conflicted about which one would be my primary controller (the black one it came with or the red one). I ultimately went with the black one, so my younger brother could &ldquo;claim&rdquo; the red controller, but for a quick second I actually considered fighting him over it. Either way though the PS4 controller is hands down my favorite controller I&rsquo;ve ever had and held, and that&rsquo;s saying something because I&rsquo;ve NEVER taken the time to appreciate a controller&rsquo;s design. It has the classic features that make it easy to just hit the ground running with any game like the joysticks, shoulder triggers, d-pad, etc. The new features include the touch-screen in the center of the controller, which I haven&rsquo;t used much in-game yet, but makes log-ins and such much faster. Then you have the new &ldquo;share&rdquo; (which I haven&rsquo;t used yet) and &ldquo;options&rdquo; buttons that are functional, but it&rsquo;s a little odd to me to not have a &ldquo;start&rdquo; button. All in all I love the design of the controller, the way it fits in my hands, the smoothness of the buttons and joysticks, the touchpad, and just the entire concept.</p>

<h5 id="old-controller-vs-new-controller-whats-the-difference">OLD CONTROLLER VS NEW CONTROLLER! WHATS THE DIFFERENCE?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> Very minor difference between the two but the NEW one has basically a new light bar. That&rsquo;s the only MAJOR difference.Other than that VERY NICE controllers! Well worth it</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-controller-feels-better-in-every-way-in-terms-of-feel">this controller feels better in every way in terms of feel</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Compared to the old Dualshock 4, this controller feels better in every way in terms of feel. The triggers, analog, and entire controller all feel solid and smooth. That is a massive plus for me because I hated the way the old black Dualshock 4 got this slimy feeling to it really annoyed me. The triggers remained very strong and springy after months of use, also a plus.The reason I deducted a star though is because I may have gotten a defective controller. When I got the controller, up on the dpad wasn&rsquo;t as clicky as the rest of the directions. It wasn&rsquo;t that big of a deal at first, but after a few months the dpad became unresponsive. The day it became unresponsive was today.I really enjoyed the controller so I am going to replace my broken one with a new one, and pray to the heavens that my blue one was just a defective one out of a bunch of non-defective ones. We shall see!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-like-a-charm">Works Like a Charm</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got this DualShock 4 for my PS4 after my previous controller for my system had broken and this controller does not disappoint, I love the fact that it also has more features than the other older previous models of this controller. This controller has another light but this time on the touch-pad and this controller supports USB mode instead of wireless mode so the signal goes through the USB instead of being wireless to reduce delay between the controller and the actual game play (other models could not do this). I would 100% Recommend this to others who are in need of a new PS4 Controller</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="not-much-is-different-from-the-new-model-from-the-old-one-and-thats-not-a-bad-thing-the-ds4-is-so-such-a-big">Not much is different from the new model from the old one and thats not a bad thing. The DS4 is so such a big &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I needed a new controller for my PS4 since the two I have I got at launch. The Rubber on the original was torn to shreds. Not much is different from the new model from the old one and thats not a bad thing. The DS4 is so such a big improvement over the DS3. The thumb sticks have a bit more traction to them then the original model but i still would of liked a bit more grip. Also the light bar display on front is fine but it doesn&rsquo;t really make any difference since a lot of games haven&rsquo;t found much use for it anyway. I wish Sony would just allow us to turn it off. The battery life on this controller is no different either. Still the 7-8 hour range unfortunately. Th blue is slightly darker than pictured but IMO it works better. If you are buying this controller and already have held a DS4 then you know what you&rsquo;re getting.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-absolutely-love-the-addition-of-the-light-bar-at-the-top">I absolutely love the addition of the light bar at the top &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I absolutely love the addition of the light bar at the top of the touchpad face. It adds an extra touch of class to an already great controller design.My only complaint would be battery life but it&rsquo;s in comparison to the DS3. However, this new model seems to have better battery life than both of the controllers I have had since purchasing my console 2 years ago, so I&rsquo;m happy with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product">great product</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>just as advertised and a great look. My son loved getting this as a birthday gift - dad loves it just as much!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="tough">Tough</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My husband drops his controller about twenty times a day and this controller has held up to the abuse he puts on it. Exactly what I was looking for.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-controller">Great controller</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought 2 of these controllers. They work great. They are both 100% authentic and came in PS4 packaging. I would definetly suggest this controller.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="its-good">Its Good (;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I got the my package and I love it I had a lot of fun with my new package so thank you amazon for my purchase</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="this-doesn-t-come-with-a-charging-cable">This doesn&rsquo;t come with a charging cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t come with a charging cable!! Why would you want to charge this? Weird, I guess. Not too happy.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="i-love-it">I love it!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Excellent product good price work well. A major help. Better price than I could find at game stop. Thanks Amazon!! ;)</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="does-the-job">Does The Job</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Good however, the little PS button doesn&rsquo;t feel as solid as the controller that came with the system. Squishy. No big deal, thought I&rsquo;d mention though</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-controler">Great controler</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great controller, slightly different color scheme than original controller but works great. you can see what color the light bar had through the touch pad</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="better-battery">Better battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Better than the original. Great feel, excellent stick movement. Way better battery life, lasts me about 6 4-hour sessions, or about a week of Netflix use before it needs charge</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="from-360-to-ds4">From 360 to DS4</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Xbox controllers for the better part of my gaming life, After PS2 I soon went to the xbox 360 for it&rsquo;s better quality games and better system all around, Since 2007 I&rsquo;ve&hellip;</p>
