<h5 id="my-roomba-is-back-to-working-like-new-since-i-installed-the-new-battery">My Roomba is back to working like new since I installed the new battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My Roomba is back to working like new since I installed the new battery. It is great to have the new brushes since the old one was totally worn out.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="outstanding">outstanding</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>more than doubled the run time</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-battery">Good battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Met my expectations very well so far. Hope time will not change my opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="working-fine-now">Working fine now</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Originally the new battery wouldn&rsquo;t charge with my Roomba 980, but the problem turned out to be a small amount of debris on the Roomba charging station contacts (needed to use a magnifying glass to see it). After scratching off the debris with my finger nail, the RavPower battery seems to be working fine. I haven&rsquo;t done a lot of testing yet to confirm that the increase from 3300 mAh (original battery) to the 5000 mAh for the RavPower battery improves the run time. It might not have a big effect as often the Roomba 980 needs to return to the charging station due to the dust bin being full before it actually runs out of charge.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="works-great">Works great</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>My iRobot Roomba 650 is about 5 years and still had the original battery. My run-time was limited to around 15 minutes. I had been putting off getting a new battery because the OEM battery is expensive and I was thinking of getting my wife a newer model Roomba. I decided to try the RAVPower 5000mAh Replacement Battery. I&rsquo;m glad I did. It works great. It&rsquo;s has a larger capacity than the OEM battery, and costs much less. After charging it up, I ran my Roomba for well over an hour and it still had power to spare. I was a little concerned about the safety of a non-OEM battery, but this battery features short circuit protection, over-current protection, low voltage protection, and a temperature control switch. It is also supposed to last around 500 charge cycles, or 2-3 years of normal usage. I&rsquo;m very happy with this battery. It works well and costs less than the original OEM battery. I can&rsquo;t ask for much else.The battery also comes with 4 replacement sweeper brushes. It&rsquo;s a nice little bonus.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="good-replacement-battery">Good replacement battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This battery worked Great. It fits perfectly in my roomba and does exactly what it is suppose to do. It does come slightly charged but I do recommend charging it for a few hours after getting it and completely draining it in order to get the battery calibrated. The installation can be a little tricky on most models in terms of opening the roomba but once inside the battery installation is fairly easy and takes less than 10 minutes to install. This battery also comes with replacement brushes!! I found this to be a surprising edition. I installed the brushes and they work just like the original and feel just like the original. It is not cheaply made and picks up dirt pretty well. The battery on a full charge can last about 3 hours on full use and it can hold a charge pretty well. The battery also has more energy then the original battery so it will last longer when in use. The battery is also compatible with most models and I have not run into any issues installing the battery into the other models as well. Overall i like this battery. It is the same size as the original, it has more power, and it comes with replacement accessories for your roomba!! It is awesome and I recommend this product!!</p>

<h5 id="performs-much-worse-than-the-oem-battery">Performs much worse than the OEM battery</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This battery more than doubled the cleaning cycle time. It has wasted over 13 hours and still never completed the cleaning cycle. Returns to charging station in 20 minutes or less. I have had good experience with other RAVPower products, but I am VERY disappointed in this one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Okay, it works, but don&rsquo;t expect it to be an adequate replacement for the 4400 mAh OEM battery. In fact, it is far inferior to the OEM battery based on the amount of time it&rsquo;s&hellip;</p>

<p>Battery does not work as expected in my Roomba 980 vacuum. Will not take a full charge and cannot finish a full cycle in 12 hrs. Very disappointing purchase.</p>

<h5 id="essentially-a-non-rechargeable-battery">Essentially a non-rechargeable battery</h5>

<p>It won&rsquo;t get charged at all after the first use.</p>

<h5 id="one-star-1">One Star</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I ordered two of these batteries and neither will take a charge.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-replacement-option">Great Replacement Option</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Swapping out the battery is pretty straight forward so anyone hesitant about that portion shouldn&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s a little more than swapping batteries in a TV remote.</p>
