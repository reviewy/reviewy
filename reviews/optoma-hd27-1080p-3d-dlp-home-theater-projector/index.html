<h5 id="nice-projector">Nice Projector</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just received the HD26 yesterday to replace my old Sanyo PLV Z5 and got it ceiling mounted and set up from the same location at about 13ft away and the image is so much brighter and clearer even with some ambient light in the room. Haven&rsquo;t played much with the image settings, but color and contrast looked good out of the box. The remote is backlit and comes on with a push of any button which is very convenient. The 10watts internal speaker is useful and quite loud enough to add a surround sound effect for my sound system since I don&rsquo;t have my rear speakers set up. This projector is a great upgrade for me coming from a 720p unit. Will be looking forward to see how good the 3D image looks in the near future. So far so good.Update:I finally got a chance to tweak the image settings to my liking. The image is even more impressive than the presets, vivid preset being the best. But here is my user settings if anyone is interested.Brightness: -5Contrast: 25Sharpness: 15Color: 15Tint: 0AdvancedGamma: GraphicBrilliantColor: 10Dynamic Black: OnColor Temp: CoolColor SettingsRed: Hue: 6Saturation: 6Gain: 16Green: Hue: 0Saturation: 0Gain: 5Blue: Hue: 3Saturation: 3Gain: 13White: Red: 1Green: 1Blue: 4Cyan: Hue:-6Saturation: 0Gain: 10Magenta: Hue: 22Saturation: 0Gain: 15Yellow: Hue: 32Saturation: 2Gain: 12Color Space: AutoEnjoy!</p>

<h5 id="best-movie-theater-experience-for-your-buck">Best Movie Theater Experience for your Buck!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was leaning towards my next TV being UHD/4K, in the 70-90&rdquo; range, but every time I looked around at the HDR/Dolby vision capable ones, OLEDs from LG, SUHD from Samsung and Sony models, I suffered severe sticker shock at the $2000-$7000+ prices! Then I got to thinking what the movie theater experience is really about, and that is presence/size! The theater is an experience because of the larger than life size with great sound and clear picture. That returned my thinking to front projection screens on 100 inches or more! While the UHD/4k/HDR flat panel TVs will give you the best contrast, blacks and detail, for the price, they will never offer the same return on investment as this Optoma HD27 on my 120&rdquo; screen that I ended up going with!This isn&rsquo;t my first projector. I had one of the earlier 720P Panasonic 3-LCD projectors about 10 years ago (2006), which at the time, was one of the most popular home theater projectors, going for $1500-$2000 range. The contrast ratio of that coveted model was only about 5500! Now we have these 1080P DLP models with 25,000 contrast ratios at amazing low prices! Coming from that previous projector to this one, the higher 1080P resolution, colors, and contrast ratio is more than enough to keep me happy. Unless you are sitting less than 6 feet from the screen, you won&rsquo;t miss the detail that a 4K version offers.My previous TV purchase was in 2009 for a Samsung 1080P Plasma flat screen. At that time, plasmas offered the best image quality, color, and contrast ratios. I spent a lot of time researching then as I did now, but spent less than half what I did on that still amazing plasma screen (still in use in my gaming room). $1400 then for 50 inches, vs $599 now for 120&rdquo;?! No contest. And the 400% bigger screen offers more perceived detail because of how much more field of vision is movie screen than before, with comparable looking contrast and dark scene detail.Out of the box, I set my picture mode to Reference, which looked more accurate, less warm than Cinema. I also set the Lamp mode to Eco, for longer lamp life, and better blacks. I tried the Dynamic Black mode, but thought it was too bright for my room haha! I used the Test Grids in the menu to center the image on my screen and dial in the focus. The Magenta Grid is easiest on your eyes for focusing.We&rsquo;ve now racked up over 60 hours with many blurays and Xbox 360 gaming sessions and are continually stunned at the quality for the price of entry! We keep commenting on how glad we are that we went for the BIG movie experience at 120 inches with this amazingly affordable and quality projector, instead of a much costlier UHD-4K tv offering at nearly <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> the screen area/size. Now, when I play 4-way split screen multiplayer with my kids on our gaming consoles, each of us enjoy a 60 inch screen to ourselves! A 70 inch TV would only give us each a meager 35 inches&hellip; The 8,000 hour lamp life on Eco mode is great for confidence that you can watch casual TV, movies, and gaming without increasing your operating cost by much. Even if you used this projector 3 hours per day, that&rsquo;s still 7+ years of bulb life! Also, not being 3-LCD chip, there are no filters to clean, so less time trying to remember to climb up to the projector, carefully remove the filter, clean it, and reinsert&hellip;The only &ldquo;con&rdquo; I will mention is that yes, this DLP chip has a white section, which means whites can be much brighter than colored portions. If you get picky and pay attention, it may bother you. On the other hand, it does give the perception of even higher contrast ratios&hellip;For an affordable ceiling mount, I went with this low profile mount: STR-MOUNTSB Silver Ticket Products LCD/DLP Low Profile Universal Projector Mount (3&rdquo; Low Profile)I also bought a 120&rdquo; screen here that I&rsquo;m not so thrilled about (see review there):Elite Screens Manual, 120-inch 16:9, Pull Down Projection Manual Projector Screen with Auto Lock, M120UWH2So enough of my babbling, take a look at my pics for the real confirmation that this Optoma HD27 will make most theater enthusiasts happy!</p>

<h5 id="very-nice">Very Nice</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is my first projector and I am only using it for an outside patio area, mostly at night. Was very impressed with picture and ease of adjustments with remote control. The speaker that is built in works great. I can use at level <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub> and hear everything great. If you turn the volume off you can barley hear the fan. Eco has a little less noise and a little less light. But if you have volume on 1 or above you can not hear anything unless it is sitting right next to you. I wish they would included a white power cord instead of black for this model. There is a picture of projector during the day against a plastic roll down and it still has a nice picture.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-the-one">This is the one.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>i read more reviews than I care to admit and almost read TOO MANY because I nearly got to the point where I thought no projector was any good. Don&rsquo;t worry about DLP rainbows with this. They don&rsquo;t exist. The contrast is good and the black is black. It&rsquo;s very quiet and the color presets are handy. Set up was also pretty simple for a fairly tech illiterate person like myself. The speaker is useable but I recommend hooking it up with external speakers or sound bar.</p>
