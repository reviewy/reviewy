<h5 id="great-size-and-i-love-the-strength-of-this-cable">Great size and I love the strength of this cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>This is a great HDMI cable. We have many of these for our various devices and I love the strength and size of this cable.Likes+ Flexible cable+ strong cable+ strong connection point+ good connection+ love the 3.3ft sizeDislikesnoneAs I mentioned, we have many HDMI cables for our various devices and connections. We have found that we like a 3ft size rather than a 6ft because we rarely need the extra length and usually end up tying it up anyway. This cord is a great size.I haven&rsquo;t found an HDMI cable that doesn&rsquo;t work as it should, so this stands apart from the rest in other ways. I like the strength and flexibility of the cable. It is strong but it isn&rsquo;t too stiff, which can be awkward when trying to make a connection or position devices a certain way. The piece that stands out the most is the large connection pieces - they are strong and thick and give you a great place to grip.Overall, this is a great cable and I highly recommend it.</p>

<h5 id="great-hdmi-cables-and-worth-buying-for-that-great-picture">Great HDMI cables and worth buying for that great picture</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>1st off I had the old crusty HDMI cables from years ago. Reviews on these HDMI cables were pretty good so I took the chance. And people weren&rsquo;t wrong! This greatly increased not only the quality of the picture but the speed at which things communicate from TV to DVD etc. With these new cables I hardly use my Amazon fire stick anymore! It&rsquo;s almost just as fast so you don&rsquo;t really see the difference. I put these on my Samsung UHD 55 curved with my Samsung UBD-K8500 4K Ultra Blu ray and Yamaha surround sound system. These wires seem to have a good build quality and are flexible and gold plated for that even faster connection. This was a good purchase and I would recommend these to anyone looking to get new HDMI cables for that crystal clear picture. Oh, yeah it even greatly improved my antenna TV picture with amazing clarity..!!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-looking-and-strong-cables">Great looking and strong cables</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I just upgraded from a 720p television after 3 years to 4k. I was using the same HDMI cables I&rsquo;ve probably had for 5 or more years at first.I wasn&rsquo;t too impressed using my old cables, sure it looked better overall with the new TV but it wasn&rsquo;t as good as I had hoped.Until I decided to pick up two of these HDMI cables and swapped out my old ones. It was like night and day. Most of the time I can&rsquo;t even tell when there&rsquo;s a minor graphical upgrade on video games or television, but this was so noticeable. they arrived in two days with Amazon Prime. Definitely worth it.</p>

<h5 id="durable-and-high-quality-great-cables-for-4k">Durable and high quality，Great cables for 4K</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I use HDMI cable a lot, I wanted something that is well built, good quality and tough. After I have got the shipment, I got the chance to use it and I am pointing out my thoughts as follows:1) It is very well built. Both end of the cable has metal housing which is something I have experienced for the first time. All other cables I have used previously had plastic casing at the end.2) The cable itself looks and feels heavy duty. Nylon layer protects the inner wire from being broken due to twisting or stuffs like that. It also helps regain its straight form when uncoiled.3) Aesthetic of this cable is also impressive. It looks amazing and high quality.4) Performance wise, it delivers same as other HDMI cables I have used previously like pixel-to-pixel mapping, hd sound etc.While its performance as same as other good quality HDMI cable, I think it stands out from the rest for its extremely good built quality and durability.</p>

<h5 id="fancy-piece-of-hdmi-cable">Fancy piece of HDMI cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>A heavy duty and fancy piece of HDMI cable. This cable supports video quality in all ranges, 4K,2064p, 1440p, 1080p, 1080i, 720p, 480p, and 480i. Both ends fit perfectly and the wire is very well made, the connectors are made with 24k gold plates, don&rsquo;t know if that makes a difference but we are satisfied with it for sure. We have the 6.6 feet that&rsquo;s plenty of flexibility for us, we are able to coil up the extra length so it doesn&rsquo;t dangle around. We had it for about two weeks, working great, hopefully it&rsquo;ll last a few years for us or until our next TV :)</p>

<h5 id="i-needed-a-not-to-long-not-to-short">I needed a not to long not to short</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>One of the things I loved was the length&ndash; I didn&rsquo;t want something to long but not to short&ndash; I hate cables all over the place&hellip;It aslo gives me perfect connection&hellip;I did notice the diffence in the in the quality of the picture too after changeing from a cheap cable. It is excellent quality.. Like what I have paid much more for in the past.. I am very happy with it&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="heavy-duty-hmdi-cable">Heavy duty HMDI cable</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I was in need of a long and good quality HDMI cable and I&rsquo;m glad I found it. It&rsquo;s long enough so I don&rsquo;t have to worry about the how far my electronics are from each other. It&rsquo;s heavy duty so no need to worry about my cats chewing on it!</p>
</blockquote>
