<h5 id="excellent-4k-tv-as-a-gaming-monitor">Excellent 4K TV as a gaming monitor.</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Pros:+ Excellent input lag @ 33.2ms. (Anything under 40.0ms for a TV is excellent!)+ Response time @ 13.2ms. (Handles motion blur very well.)+ Outputs 60 FPS in 4K with HDR.+ 10 bit color depth with Wide Color Gamut.+ User interface (TV menu) is easy to navigate.+ Good price vs. quality.Cons:- VA Panel, so wont have the better viewing angles of the 49 inch IPS version- Remote does not have back lit function.Other Thoughts:If your considering using this TV as a computer monitor, I highly recommend it! This would also be great for a bedroom. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it for a living/family/great room where people would be viewing it from multiple angles since it&rsquo;s a VA panel. I would recommend the 49 inch version of this TV which has the IPS Panel.All my knowledge for this TV came from rtings.com. They review TV&rsquo;s and headphones in depth, very well. I highly recommend you visit the website when choosing what TV or headphones to buy.As for computer use, this TV has a very low input lag at 33.2ms which is one of the main reasons I purchased this 4K TV since I would primarily be using it for gaming. Anything below 40ms input lag for a TV is excellent. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if I&rsquo;m surfing the net or playing DOOM or GTA 5, I never feel any lag between the mouse and the display and yes, that&rsquo;s at 4K resolution with HDR.Second of all, if you&rsquo;ve considered other displays including the WASABI MANGO UHD430 which is also a 43 inch 4K display, do your research. I couldn&rsquo;t find the input lag specification anywhere and had only read from someone else&rsquo;s comment that it wasn&rsquo;t good, but again do your own research. I push the importance of having low input lag because when you start noticing a delay between you and the computer it feels like your computer is responding slowly when in reality it&rsquo;s just the display struggling to keep up. It&rsquo;s a bad experience and it&rsquo;s very annoying and trust me it&rsquo;s very noticeable.Last of all, if you&rsquo;ve considered getting an ultra wide monitor, consider getting a large 4K display instead. A display around 40 to 43 inches seems to be the magic number. You can keep the scaling in Windows at 100% so, if your used to using a 24 to 27 inch monitor, the start menu, text and all the icons will be pretty much the same size your used to seeing now when you go to a 40 to 43 inch monitor.See, the best part about a large 4K monitor is having 4 times the area to work and play in compared to a 1080p or even a 2K monitor!You can load two web pages side-by-side and see them in their entirety with minimal scrolling up and down.If your a programmer, you can see more of your code in MS Visual Studio without having to scroll up and down and side to side as much which is very beneficial.If you&rsquo;re a day trader or accountant, doing any spread sheet analysis is also better since you can see much more of a large spread sheet, not to mention having multiple windows/charts open and being able to see them clearly.If you do video or audio editing, you will have the width of an ultra wide monitor, but even more headroom.And of course watching 4K video is amazing not to mention playing games in 4K.In conclusion, I highly recommend going with this TV. It works great as a bedroom TV and is excellent as a large format computer monitor.Again, the only thing that can be considered a down side, besides the remote not having a back light, would be that this 43 inch TV is not an IPS panel, so you wont have the awesome viewing angels like the 49 inch IPS version. When sitting in front of the TV at about a 3 foot distance, I do notice a very slight color shift on the sides only. However, it&rsquo;s only noticeable on something bright white like a spread sheet or a white web page, not during gaming or watching movies/shows etc. The upside of having the VA panel though is that the contrast is better then the IPS panel. The blacks are deep and produce a very good picture quality. It&rsquo;s about 3877:1 for the VA vs. 1000:1 for the IPS.Hope this review helped you and please visit rtings.com to do your own research.</p>

<p>Picture:the 49in triluminous display looks fantastic! The edge lit led panel has no light bleeding or clouding and blacks look extremely deep. The color gamut is a bit lower than top end sets, however if you&rsquo;re new to WCG tvs you really won&rsquo;t notice at all. Reds are mega vibrant, greens are bright, and blues look pronounced. The tv is uglier than the x850d but it also cost a great deal less and delivers all the main features in a smaller size. HDR, is the best thing your eyes will ever see in 2016! This tv does it well.Resolution:4k 2160p looks fantastic. the tv is a native 60hz tv with motionflow 240. This is NOT a deal breaker. You see hz and fps ARE the same thing. They both measure motion refreshments. The only difference is that tvs display this measurement info, differently from source devices like bluray players. 60hz is an average consumer&rsquo;s tv refresh rate, while 240hz is an extreme user&rsquo;s tv refresh rate. 60fps is the fastest measurement in consumer level media,or as you may have seen it hdmi 2.0 4k/60fps. The only exception to this is pc, which can do well over 120fps for gaming or advanced technology applications. Thats why high end tvs push 240 native, so that pc gamers and power users are accommodated. If you aren&rsquo;t pc gaming, or working for nasa, a 60 hz refresh rate DOES NOT matter. All bluray discs play at 30fps max, and all UHD discs play at 60fps max. You don&rsquo;t need a tv that can refresh 240 times per frame if your source can only refresh 60 times per frame. The 4k experienced here is a fantastic spectrum of HDR vibrancy and extraordinary motion. 1080p, looks almost as fantastic as 4k here. Loads of detail and tack sharp imagery. 720p looks good. Obviously not 1080p good, but this tv holds well here. 480p or the dvd sd quality is awful. 480p dvds are grainy and oversharpened, overshadowed and really feels clunky. If you ever seen 480p on a samsung this will eat you alive. If its not HD, FHD, or UHD, don&rsquo;t expect much.Sound:Just buy a soundbar, the sound is okay but you&rsquo;re missing out by not spending the $130 to get a basic 2.0 experience.Android:Works just like it does on all 2016 XBR tvs. The layout is tile based, fells good, and though not perfectlyresponsive 100% of the time feels is a nice touch. YouTube, Netflix, and hulu all here. Works great.Summary:For $899You get; 4k hdr, wcg,(wide color gamut),deep blacks, flagship UI,sleek design, and hdmi 2.0; you also get the next industry standard and XBR bragging rights. Dont let the 60hz scare you. It&rsquo;s all marketing, you really don&rsquo;t need more than 60hz. I highly recommend this to ALL who have a lower tv budget but want flagship quality. WARNING: buying this on Amazon will likely result in a set with uniformity issues, the quality control has gone way down and you probably will need to play a lottery. I don&rsquo;t think the tv warehouse is climate controlled, to many people have issues here but go to best buy and are just fine. If you want to buy it in Amazon just keep in mind any tv over 50in will be sent via a freight company, and will voit you 2 day prime shipping. If you have any issues on anything 55in and up, large items will be the people to talk to. They are very rude so be aware. As far as the tv goes, yeah dude totally worth buying with your hard earned money. 👍</p>
