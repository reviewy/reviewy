<h5 id="these-batteries-are-not-good-i-have-always-bought-wasabi-batteries-because-they">These batteries are not good. I have always bought Wasabi batteries because they &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries are not good. I have always bought Wasabi batteries because they always were a great value. But not these. I have purchased 6 of these and they just don&rsquo;t work very well. I only get about a half hour to 45 minutes of recording time with them. My old Sony batteries still work better, and I spent a few more dollars and bought the Rav Power ones and they are doing great. These batteries work, but they don&rsquo;t hold a charge like they should. Like last night I was recording a conference, I knew I wanted to have plenty of power so I made sure the Rav Power ones were in my camera&rsquo;s battery pack. I recorded for an hour and forty five minutes and only went through one battery. That was surprising. If I had 2 wasabis in my battery pack, they both would be dead after about an hour. Trust me, go with the Rav Power, they are way better than these.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bought these despite a handful of negative reviews. They may not get quite as many shots, but they work, I have 2 OEM batteries and these 2. I just pulled one out of the bag I carry them in an popped in into my camera - 100% charge. I think I charged these a month ago or so. So some of the claims of them losing their charge within days &ldquo;just sitting&rdquo; may just be a bad battery.I shoot a mix of video and stills, so getting an accurate shot count is difficult unless I just go into a pure testing phase, but they seem to work well for my needs.</p>

<h5 id="battery-life-is-terrible-and-reliability-is-terrible-bad-batch">Battery life is terrible, and reliability is terrible. Bad batch?</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Battery life is terrible, and reliability is terrible. I have purchased two 2-packs (4 batteries total) and they don&rsquo;t compare to the Sony batteries, and one of the three was dead after one charge. Absolutely terrible product. Wasabi has been my favorite off-brand of replacement batteries and they are usually very good&hellip; but this batch and another batch that fits another camera have not been good. These have been by far the worst batteries I&rsquo;ve owned. Perhaps I got a bad batch. I don&rsquo;t know. I idiotically threw away the packaging so I probably can&rsquo;t return them now, but I had to post this review out of disappointment. Quality control on these was terrible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="larger-capacity-than-stock-batteries-and-a-great-package">Larger capacity than stock batteries and a great package!</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>The charger is small and uses micro USB to charge so I can use the same charger that came with my Sony a6300 camera. The batteries have more capacity than the stock sony batteries coming in at 1300mAh. I think it might even run cooler than the stock battery as I&rsquo;ve had better run time recording in 4k with my sony a6300 using these batteries. It&rsquo;s also very helpful to have a total of 3 batteries so I can swap them frequently to keep the a6300 cooler while recording 4k. Charger also works for the sony stock battery. This is a great little package and I highly recommend it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-product-excellent-customer-support">Great Product, Excellent Customer Support</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>As a landscape and nature photographer most of the time I&rsquo;m shooting outside hiking and backpacking to remote locations, and so I chose this particular version because of the USB powered charger. I usually have at least a battery pack on me, but for longer backpacking and car camping trips I also have solar chargers with me. So with this charger I&rsquo;ll be able to keep the batteries for my Sony a6000 charged for any length of trip, since I live in an area with lots of sun most of the year. For road tripping I can also use my USB charger adaptor which fits into the lighter socket of my car. I also liked the slightly different design of the charger, which holds the batteries upright. I find it&rsquo;s just a little quicker and easier to swap batteries in and out than my other chargers where the batteries lay flat. This is the first Wasabi Charger that I&rsquo;ve seen with a USB cord, it&rsquo;s brilliant for outdoor and travel photographers to be able to charge up easily in the field, and I hope they come out with USB powered chargers for my other cameras too.I have bought several Wasabi Charger Battery packs and always been very happy with them. This is the first time that I have had any kind of problem, and it was a minor one at that. The customer service I received from Blue Nook was stellar! After replying to their email supplying the details they needed so that they could replace the correct part they replied in less than 24 hours saying they were shipping out a replacement. I received it within 72 hours of replying to their email. I am very happy with both the product and customer service.</p>

<h5 id="works-as-good-as-oem">Works as good as OEM</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>I read some tips on using this for a5100 and apparently you shouldn&rsquo;t do it. In my experience, these are excellent batteries and work just as good as OEM batteries. Love having the security that I have plenty of juice to last an entire day or more of shooting photos/videos. Hub charger is excellent and compact. MicroUSB input. Indicator lights to quickly tell the charge vs fully charged status. Overall great product. I also have Wasabi batteries for the GoPro Hero 5 and those work great as well. So far so good Wasabi!</p>

<h5 id="power-batteries-prior-to-these-two-and-they-work-amazing-i-started-just-started-doing-videography-and-i-use">&hellip; Power batteries prior to these two and they work amazing I started just started doing videography and I use &hellip;</h5>

<blockquote>
<p> 7/22/17I already own two Wasabi Power batteries prior to these two and they work amazing I started just started doing videography and I use a SONY a6500 and during a 12hr shoot I use about three batteries now I gave this a 4 Star because the flashing off and on green and red light had me worried but both batteries did charge 100% so I guess I&rsquo;m ok with it for now besides that Wasabi sells one heck of a battery.</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-alternative-to-the-name-brand-batteries">Great alternative to the name brand batteries</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries are just as good as the Sony branded batteries, and half the cost. It&rsquo;s nice to get a dual charger as well. The charger seems to take a longer time to charge the batteries fully, and the lights don&rsquo;t always seem to work correctly (red for needing charge and green for complete). Overall though, it&rsquo;s a good value to have with the A7 series cameras that use up batteries quickly. These batteries technically have more mAh at 1300, vs. the Sony branded batteries at 1020mAh, so in theory they should last almost 30% longer, but in my experience, they&rsquo;re almost the same (under an hour for both if rolling). For the money, stock up on a few of these and you&rsquo;ll be set.</p>

<h5 id="i-would-recommend-ravpower-for-sony-np-fw50-battery-charger-set">I would recommend &ldquo;RAVPower For Sony NP-FW50 Battery Charger Set</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>These batteries do not work with battery grips. However, they seem to work without a battery pack. I would recommend &ldquo;RAVPower For Sony NP-FW50 Battery Charger Set.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="great-to-charge-2-batteries-at-a-time">Great to charge 2 batteries at a time</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>Great to charge 2 batteries at a time, but sometimes the charging light indicator doesn&rsquo;t work correctly. Still great &amp; recommended item!</p>
</blockquote>

<h5 id="terrible">TERRIBLE</h5>

<blockquote>
<p>After 48 hours charging I had 62% charge. HEED THIS and Warnings from others! Luckily I ordered before a big trip and have time to return.</p>
